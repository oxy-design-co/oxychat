**Duration**: 58:53  
**People**: Andrew Smyth, Rachel Xie, Justin Yeh, Natalie Godwin, Karen Javalera, Anthony Ferrara, Lauren Chadwell, Spencer Ramirez, Nohar Wahnishe, Patrick Carl, Joe Maxwell, Chris Wilson, Kyra, Kyra Jeanne, and Sydney Johnson

[0:00] **Anthony Ferrara**: Out. Hope nothing burned down or went crazy while I was gone the last couple days.

[0:12] **Chris Wilson**: Everything went pretty well.

[0:16] **Anthony Ferrara**: Thanks for your support. Thanks for holding it down on sales front, Andrew, creative side, and excited for this week. Joe is out. Natalie is on a Walmart call, so I will lead the discussion. I think we're waiting for a couple more, but we'll get started for now. Cool. Big big thing before I get started, Spencer and I will be in a session with Toby. Toby's coming to Phoenix, and we're really trying to lock in the Roy. We could start with Roy and LinkedIn.

[1:04] **Anthony Ferrara**: Toby's coming to Phoenix to really lock down some of the Roy direction, how we're gonna deviate from what we're building with Ola, more aesthetic exercises. So we will be kinda locked in to, like, morning and afternoon sessions tomorrow and Wednesday. Spencer, like, if there's unmovable meetings, it's totally expected that you're gonna have to walk out of the session to, like, lead a call. So we could talk about that after this. Which ones maybe Chris or Sid can can lead and which ones that you absolutely have to be on. Yeah. So that's top of mind today.

[1:43] **Anthony Ferrara**: I set fifteen minute fifteen minutes with you after this to kinda go through that.

[1:47] **Anthony Ferrara**: I

[1:49] **Spencer Ramirez**: we can go over it. It's super quick. So the only it's all basically internal. The only one will be Iron and Ken, which we can talk about when we get there. But everything else is I I moved around or cleared up

[2:05] **Andrew Smyth**: for those three days.

[2:07] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. So, yeah, expect a little bit of musical chairs Tuesday and Wednesday with scheduling since, we're doing an on-site here at the office. And then, yeah, Chris, I think we might I'll figure out the right session to pull you in and Nohar and Patrick as well. We just kinda blocked off morning and afternoon. And definitely, when we're speaking about LinkedIn and Ola specifically and deadlines around that, I'll make sure you guys are invited at the right time so that we could do some Asana cleanup and force Toby to answer questions.

[2:43] **Anthony Ferrara**: But the goal of that session is really, like, lock in the Roy branding, figure out what we are borrowing from LinkedIn and just conceptually, like, changing. And then he's also demoing, like, the actual goggles. Like, he built the whole meta goggles thing, so we kinda have to experience it to, like, know these new design paradigms. So that's the goal. And we'll pull in the right individuals as we finish planning out those sessions and the goals for each one. So that's what to expect there.

[3:20] **Anthony Ferrara**: I guess, quick, Spencer, on Roy, any updates with Flavia and what to expect early this week? Yeah.

[3:29] **Spencer Ramirez**: I mean, I think she sent it last week. Nothing has been updated since last week, but she just sent over I basically picked out one logo, both logomark and wordmark. She gave us, like, four to five options. You left comments. Toby left comments. That's where we're at. So it's just expanding the brand out from there, basically. Yeah.

[3:55] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. If you could get so she so she has what she needs. She's working on revisions. She has the direction. Okay. If you could get an hint from her, sometimes she doesn't give, like, an estimated turnaround time.

[4:09] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. I think so. Okay. I might need to give her, like, very clear instruction versus just, like, Figma, but I'll clear that up today.

[4:21] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Yeah. That's one of the goals of him coming out, so he's gonna wanna know, like, where we're at. And I think that'll just align the conversation. Okay. Ola, are we still where we were at last week where Toby has not responded? We don't have, like, clear deadlines. He's kinda ghosting us. Is there any new updates there?

[4:44] **Chris Wilson**: At this point, that is my understanding. We have no new updates.

[4:49] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. I will force him to get feedback, and then I'll make sure we have we dedicate at least one of those sessions to bearing all that stuff up. The only thing I know is that things have shifted since the workplace summit and the demo that he provided. And there's more important meetings with, like, the CEO to kinda share what was shared at the workplace summit. So I think timelines are shifting on him. Cool. Next one, better days.

[5:26] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. We just have, like, a quick kickoff. Not it's not a kickoff. We're just gonna do an intro call on Wednesday because I prefer for Joe to be on the actual kickoff call so he can do his spiel, next week. And for this week, I'm just we're just gonna meet with the interior designers, understand where they're at, how much of the, like, materials and color decisions have already been made for the space, tie that back to our discovery and our branding, internally, synced with Sid and Karen on just a quick overview of the project.

[6:09] **Spencer Ramirez**: So everybody will be there. Quick intros, the thirty minute intros this week, and then we'll schedule that discovery session to follow.

[6:18] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Is this just with us and the interior design firm, or is Kel gonna be there as well?

[6:23] **Spencer Ramirez**: I think Kel will be there too.

[6:25] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Anything we should prepare, or is it just like, hey. What's up? Here's what we do. I don't think

[6:32] **Spencer Ramirez**: we're good. I'm trying to keep it low key for this one. I just wanna I mean, we can, like we'll inter introduce each other. You know, they can understand the functions of what we do, and then I just wanna be like, we just wanna use this time, say hello, and understand where you're at, and basically have them show us. Because they have a bunch of renderings and progress that they've done so far. So it just Right. Yeah.

[6:54] **Anthony Ferrara**: I still have this in HubSpot, it's at January 19 deadline. Does that sound about right, or is that wrong? Eighty four days. That

[7:04] **Spencer Ramirez**: sounds right. We don't have a exact deadline yet, but we can firm that up on our kickoff call.

[7:10] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Yeah. Oh, and I just saw your proposed time, Spencer. I didn't realize Kelly was at that time, so I moved it. Cool. I just moved it to kickoff. This one's for you, Justin Jameson's portfolio visuals. Did you get to sync with him, or were there any requirements sent to you?

[7:38] **Rachel Xie**: No. I don't think I got any details so far.

[7:42] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Feel free to chime in in the channel. I know he has a Walmart call right now, and it's really blocked by him right now.

[7:54] **Rachel Xie**: Yeah. I think you linked the calendar, and I don't know if he he thumbs it up, but he I don't know if he set up a time.

[8:02] **Anthony Ferrara**: He didn't. So maybe just chime in with him. Be like, hey. We're waiting. Let us know. Cool. And there's no, like, hard deadline on this one. I'm gonna set it to mid November. Okay. Next one, fit a c.

[8:24] **Spencer Ramirez**: We had a good week. I can let Andrew speak on that, but go ahead. You can go first, Andrew. I'll follow-up.

[8:29] **Andrew Smyth**: Oh, yeah. We had a really good week. First three introductions of, like,

[8:33] **Chris Wilson**: the first tranche of introductions. Kevin, they're really excited, trying to figure out how to deal with it all. Spencer and I have been internal later today to download our own thoughts and continue the project, and we gotta

[8:51] **Andrew Smyth**: get those last two introductions scheduled for this week.

[8:56] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. So I messaged with Luis this weekend, and he was wondering if we have time today. He was just asking for a time. So, do you want me to schedule something separate from our meeting or have him jump into that?

[9:14] **Andrew Smyth**: I mean, he can jump into that for, like, the first fifteen or something.

[9:18] **Chris Wilson**: Okay.

[9:18] **Spencer Ramirez**: Cool. Sweet. Perfect. I'll see how that works. Okay.

[9:21] **Anthony Ferrara**: Any follow-up on Danielle? I think that was the only intro I made.

[9:26] **Spencer Ramirez**: It did follow-up. Kevin followed up from. So they're kinda taking that and running with it. Yep.

[9:35] **Anthony Ferrara**: And I have it at November 28, which is a month from tomorrow.

[9:39] **Andrew Smyth**: Mhmm.

[9:41] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Soraban.

[9:49] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. So I haven't sent it over to the client yet, but I think on Friday, I think Flavia had sent over the, like, new new concepts. So we sent over, like, on Wednesday or something, revised concepts from the single like, the the the one concept we refined down to. So we were, like, following our process, going well, almost done, and then they wanted to, switch it. But we do have four rounds in the scope. This will be our fourth round of, like, new explorations.

[10:28] **Spencer Ramirez**: So, yeah, sending that over to the client to see if they can, hammer out one that they wanna actually move forward with. The brand is locked in. Type's locked in. All the extensions were kinda down to the logo. Date's thirty first on that. We have our call with them tomorrow. Has already done the first round of presentation slides, so I do have that to present on our call tomorrow. Social media slides are baked into the brand guide, which are done.

[10:58] **Spencer Ramirez**: So, as far as the extensions of what we're responsible for, we're tracking well towards Friday or whenever that is. I think it's Friday as our deadline. But, yeah, goal tomorrow for the call is to go over the new logos that we sent, see if we can get a, decision, finalize the brand, finalize the brand guide, finalize the presentation templates, and finalize the social media templates all by Friday to close this out. And then Andrew might be able to speak on it, but we're gonna try and fast follow into some additional deliverables on a extended scope.

[11:40] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. I was just picking addendum for another two weeks or something. The biggest thing is a logo animation with Kyra.

[11:49] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Gotcha. Chris is actually at the door, so I have to let him in. He does not have a key yet, so give me twenty seconds.

[12:02] **Spencer Ramirez**: Sid, maybe if you could help just send this over to the client in the shared channel, what Flavia sent at 11:30 on Friday.

[12:13] **Sydney Johnson**: Yeah. Of course. Cool. I'll I'll do that right now.

[12:29] **Anthony Ferrara**: Sorry, guys. Okay. Next one. So feels good. So you guys know Chris is more and more and more available. So if you guys need any additional support on any of these projects that are closing out here in the next, like, thirty days, please share if there's a meeting that we can help take. My calendar is very available as well. So please reach out for help if you need to find, like, no time to close out the last couple things on any of these brand marketing projects. But it feels like Sorbonne's in a good spot.

[13:11] **Anthony Ferrara**: Oxy demo reel.

[13:16] **Spencer Ramirez**: Finished the brief. Went over it with Sid and Kyra either Thursday or Friday. I can't remember when we did that. But yeah. So next steps will be, like, getting in front of Gabe, possibly you, Anthony, if you wanna see it, just to kind of it it's just bottling up everything we've already talked about, putting it in a nice document for collaborators to be able to reference and use.

[13:40] **Spencer Ramirez**: So from there, I think we had kinda said that our next time line or our next deliverable for or work for this week would be to kind of look at it on the time line and kinda catalog the stock image, stock footage that we're gonna need and start to go out and source that, so we can drop that into the timeline. I think that's gonna be, important.

[14:01] **Spencer Ramirez**: And then, you know, Kyra and Gabe to start, you know, collecting all the assets necessary for each project, making sure we have everything that they need to be able to, you know, add into the video, as far as, like, screens and case studies and whatever. And, yeah, that's definitely enough work for the week on that.

[14:27] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. I do not wanna block this. I actually hung out with Gabe yesterday. So I think I think maybe proactively setting a time, Kyra, with Gabe and Sid, maybe the minimum amount of people I need to be there, Sid, Kyra, and Gabe, to kinda share the brief with him and then figure out how we're gonna divide the work between you two. Mhmm. Gabe is definitely leading the the work. Kyra's supporting the work as far as, like, the animation work. And then I'm hoping, Sid, you could drive it forward with between both of them.

[15:08] **Chris Wilson**: Yep.

[15:09] **Anthony Ferrara**: Does that sound good? Do you guys need any other support on that one?

[15:14] **Sydney Johnson**: I think we're good. I also out of gate to our weekly demos and calls. But, Kyra, I'll message you, and we can get a time going for just me, you, and Gabe to talk.

[15:25] **Nohar Wahnishe**: Yes. Sounds good.

[15:29] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Well, yeah. I think I've seen enough of the concept, so don't let me hold you back on approvals or anything like that. Enroll.

[15:44] **Nohar Wahnishe**: Enroll. Yes. Okay. So go live move to November 5. We still have some product we need updates and hero images updates. I'm trying to collaborate with Root and River on the copy that did flag that it's, you know, kinda AI driven. And so I'm trying to get them to help out with more with the strategy and just, like, minimizing a lot of the copy because a lot of it is repeating. And we're hoping to get to staging by October 29, so that includes the the content forms and testing.

[16:27] **Nohar Wahnishe**: QA will be October 29 to November 4. So that should set up set us well to for the go live on November 5. So, yeah, I think we're in a good place. We just have to update a bunch of the vignettes and images and copy.

[16:50] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Cool. I did. Emily and Chris were actually at this cowboy thing I was at this week, so I got to talk to them about this project while wearing a cowboy hat. Cool. They did express a couple concerns they had, like, the and this is mainly for you and Nohar Nohar and Andrew. But they were they're kinda confused at the scope of work. I I think we might need to I think, Nohar and Andrew, if you can find a time to sync with Chris and Emily just to, like, hear them out a little bit.

[17:28] **Anthony Ferrara**: I could even join that if it's today and we find a time. But they were like, originally, the scope of work was to, like, audit and review and refine. And then Chris went in, and she was, like, explaining exactly what she did. Like, there's certain grammatical things that make it feel very AI. They're like, the generated texts. They were using the word, like, empower a 100,000 times. And it feels like Kevin's, like, resistant. Like, no. This is locked. This can't change. And then they're like, okay. So, like, what do you want me to do?

[18:05] **Anthony Ferrara**: And it it feels like they did what was asked, like an audit, but they're just confused. Like, what is the I think we need to huddle with them and look at the scope of work and be like, what are are we aligned on what is being asked of the copywriting team? Because it they were saying and maybe you could color this in a bit, but they were saying that it feels a little like, what what is the goal here? Because it was all AI generated. And they're, like, pointing out things that they could refine.

[18:33] **Anthony Ferrara**: Do you have any insights on that, Nohar?

[18:37] **Nohar Wahnishe**: Nothing was ever locked. Never even used that term. What was, I guess, locked was the the document where Kevin added all the copy to, and we just transferred it into Figma. So we just told them the copy is in Figma, so we're look at the Figma copy, not the documentation. Maybe she thought, like, we meant that having the documentation locked means copy is locked. Nothing's gonna change. But I've raised this up before. Kevin is struggling to see the value of Root and Reaver. Like, where can they really step in and help?

[19:17] **Nohar Wahnishe**: So when we try to when I reached out to Chris, she was saying, oh, we're not supposed to be editing any copy, just reviewing. I'm like, okay. So then I asked her to review, and she's like, well, our scope of work was to edit copy. I'm like, well, that's not what you said. So I don't know what exactly was fine, but I did tell them, like, Kevin wants to see, you know, your value essentially. And if there's no value, he rather transfer some of the budget for more design work.

[19:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Yeah. Chris specifically tends to have a lot of boomer tendencies. So maybe maybe you guys could set thirty minutes with her, look at the scope of work, and align on, like, what the best value is. Because I still think my recollection of the scope of work is to edit and audit what was written. So just ask her.

[20:20] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. Just to make sure we're all have an understanding of it. So they were required to have a 100 of the written copy. Kevin was to provide it. And Root and River was gonna serve as, like, an audit editing partner and help them finalize all the website copy. So if Kevin's, like, rejecting them, then it's an interesting position. I don't really know.

[20:46] **Nohar Wahnishe**: Encore wire He's not rejecting at all. There was just, like, one comment about the CTA, and Kevin is like, oh, we actually talked about this for a while and we decided to move forward with this language for the CTA. That was the only thing that he pushed back on.

[21:01] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Cool. Yeah. Maybe maybe we should just huddle with her and just figure out where the resistance is. But in my view, as long as they're looking over the copy, providing suggestions, doing more than grammatical, like, do we make it more punchy or higher conversion rate than we've delivered. But we should just, like, take control of it before it becomes a problem.

[21:29] **Nohar Wahnishe**: Okay. I'll schedule a time with Andrew, Chris, and I.

[21:37] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. And then we could figure out how to respond to Kevin from there.

[21:42] **Chris Wilson**: Sounds good.

[21:43] **Anthony Ferrara**: Thank you. Thanks for I know we're at the finish line. I adjusted the date accordingly. So November 5. Right?

[21:49] **Nohar Wahnishe**: Yes. Thank you.

[21:52] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Possibility website. Justin, I feel like this one's you.

[21:59] **Rachel Xie**: Yeah. We have some concepts and iterations that you can take a look at for the squeeze page and the resources and the case studies. And yeah. So it's up to your feedback, I guess.

[22:14] **Anthony Ferrara**: I think I shared it with them while I was out. And he we got good feedback, if I recall. I'm looking at the channel. Great stuff. No real notes. He left some feedback.

[22:24] **Rachel Xie**: Oh, yeah. I I addressed this already.

[22:27] **Anthony Ferrara**: If you could chime in and let him know. Yeah. I think if he's good there, we could close this out. Cool. And then, Andrew, we're gonna have to talk about phase two. Cool.

[22:41] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. I tried to schedule a time with him on Friday, but it's his wedding anniversary. Like, he was out, and then we just couldn't catch up in the morning. He was busy. So cool.

[22:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: Our position on that, so you know, is the definition of done was the brand guide, the website, landing page designed and developed, and then these new designs, but we're not developing it. Like so the minimum that needs to be scoped is developing those pages with compiled road and whatever else might need. I don't know what that scope looks like. And, Chris, I think this is the perfect time to get you involved in this project.

[23:24] **Anthony Ferrara**: And maybe, like, we're having discussions about reformatting the possibility retainer, and I think this next scope should kind of, like we should cover all of this.

[23:38] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. Sounds good. With that possibility meeting, I know you had canceled it from last week. Did we get that rescheduled?

[23:44] **Anthony Ferrara**: We did. If you're not on it, I'll add you to it. The goal of that call this week is is more like how do we manage webs they don't really understand websites. They don't understand the reality of them. They don't understand the differences between Squarespace and WordPress. So it's it's to introduce you, Chris, and to give my hot takes on what they're doing wrong and how we can fix our collaborations. And they're kinda treating it like these retainer requests, that's not that's not how it works. And they need a lot of education, I feel like.

[24:26] **Chris Wilson**: That sounds good. Cool.

[24:30] **Anthony Ferrara**: So that one's at the finish line. Shiloh, feels like Justin's been insanely busy. We've all tried to get him to launch the new site. Was there any updates while I was out?

[24:44] **Chris Wilson**: No. So we know Justin. No. But, Andrew, you were checking on the SOW for the blog design. You're maybe gonna see about how we would wanna if they wanted to use that information at or the collateral side of things to go ahead and just do the blog design?

[25:00] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. I haven't he hasn't gone back to me on anything. I've asked him about, like, the animation video as well. Nothing.

[25:07] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Oh,

[25:10] **Spencer Ramirez**: I delivered the AI file of the the editable AI file for the trade show banners. Also, no acknowledgment, but it is

[25:22] **Chris Wilson**: You know, we're not, like, there for it now.

[25:23] **Spencer Ramirez**: We need real quick looking back on possibilities. Wanna give the update that the typo and user flow both completed the whatever with Jonathan was questioning. So we built out image prompts for mid journey that they can copy and paste. We built out wider colors with a softer palette so that they can be a little bit more versatile. Whatever. Anything you talked about. So I'll clean that up and send it over today.

[25:56] **Anthony Ferrara**: Amazing. That's not easy work. That's a weird complex request. Thank you for handling it. So, yeah, I think we've I think we've been firing on all cylinders with possibility. But I think this week, there's gonna be a lot of discussions about how we repurpose the retainer, how we do phase two for the website. I know they're gonna want us to focus more on their brand and, like, building templates rather than, like, doing telly style, like, delivery of assets. So a lot to discuss there. Chris, can you own pinging Justin

[26:40] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. For

[26:42] **Anthony Ferrara**: the for the website, the banners. And and then, Andrew, you can separately bother him about other sales stuff.

[26:54] **Chris Wilson**: For sure, Patrick.

[26:55] **Anthony Ferrara**: I guess, website, the blog, and the

[26:57] **Chris Wilson**: For the banners, we're just looking for feedback. Correct?

[27:01] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah. They're print ready. Right, Spencer?

[27:06] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. They're designed on the template that they gave us. The text is not outlined. That's the only thing. But that's what Justin asked for so that he could go and edit the text. Okay.

[27:18] **Anthony Ferrara**: I'll text him too. See what's up. Piper.

[27:30] **Spencer Ramirez**: I can

[27:30] **Chris Wilson**: chime in. Or, Spencer, do you wanna go go ahead with and I'll we'll I'll discuss through the technical side of things after.

[27:35] **Spencer Ramirez**: Sure. The good news is yeah. So everybody worked hard last week to get the phase two pages launched I mean, staged and ready to go. Most of that pay those phase two pages, the fast follows, were pages that she doesn't have any content for yet. She's aware of that. So they're staged and ready to go. We still took the opportunity to say, hey. We kind of fulfilled our timeline in that in that degree or our scope. So that was last Friday was our last weekly call. We pushed a couple pages through.

[28:12] **Spencer Ramirez**: KMF worked all week, revising the, markup comments and tending to anything that came in. So, yeah, the we were able to push a couple pages live. And the biggest thing, I guess, is, you know, continuing to get, the Stripe stuff, but I'll let Chris speak to that. I guess on the yeah. Just on the client side, we're done with our weekly cadence. I told her to, you know, reach out when she's ready to go live with some of those pages, and we can obviously, in good faith, help her get those live.

[28:46] **Spencer Ramirez**: But, other than that, we are pretty much fulfilled.

[28:51] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. From a technical perspective, I pushed the updates live on the twenty fourth around, like, 6PM, I wanna say. So her site has those reflected. I tried to push her towards just doing a Stripe checkout. But since she wants to sell the things, she wants to go ahead and go with ecommerce. I know that part of the scope is actually setting up that first experience anyway so she can get her magazine subscription.

[29:13] **Chris Wilson**: So I'm just gonna work with her this week, because there's some questions within WooCommerce I need to just get answered before, I can get it finalized. So I'm just gonna have a quick call with her. She's gonna walk me through. I'll get those answered, and then, I'll have her basically ready to rock and roll.

[29:26] **Anthony Ferrara**: Awesome, guys. That's awesome to hear. The specifically, Chris, like, when we huddle this week, I wanna use Piper as, like, the demo the to set the level of expectation on how we hand off websites, like, with training videos. Maybe you and I can, like, focus on that in our afternoon session today. Like, what are the most common things she's gonna have to do? Like, just general Elementor training, like, couple Loom videos that's like, here's how you do most of the things you're gonna need to do on the site so you don't need to call us.

[30:08] **Anthony Ferrara**: Here's where everything lives. Here's who you contact if you need help kind of stuff so we could close it out. Absolutely. Cool. Moving on. I know I'm a lot slower than Joe. Spring training.

[30:32] **Rachel Xie**: This week, I'm gonna follow-up with Lauren about the Google Analytics setup. Other than that, I think we're really just waiting for the schedule to be released.

[30:42] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah. I talked to everyone there at the the ride, which is tied to this account, and it's crazy how many people have not seen and what we've been working on for, like, the last year besides Lauren. But, yeah, Lauren is just waiting for the schedule, and then she was very complimentary of, like, the plan, how we kinda thought through everything and, like, the in between states where the schedule's not dropped. Mhmm. Oh, yeah. That's great. Probably won't be on the internal this week because the Toby sessions. But yeah.

[31:21] **Anthony Ferrara**: As as long as we have, like, a clear like, if we get an email when the schedule drops, do we know what needs to happen? Do is Compiled Road aware of what they're responsible for and what Lauren has to populate herself? I think just if we can send a couple messages, Rachel, to with Chris and compiled Rogue, I'm like, we're fine as soon as the schedule drops.

[31:45] **Chris Wilson**: Okay.

[31:46] **Anthony Ferrara**: But I think we're in a good spot and just holding until then.

[31:49] **Rachel Xie**: Okay.

[31:55] **Anthony Ferrara**: Sun chase. Okay.

[32:00] **Chris Wilson**: At this stage, it's basically ready to go. We were waiting on their updates if there's anything that they wanted to change, if there were some things that they requested. And, basically, we just need the QA and push live. So I guess the question is, are those updates completed at this stage so I could push live today at some point?

[32:22] **Spencer Ramirez**: What's the project? Sorry.

[32:23] **Anthony Ferrara**: Sun chase.

[32:24] **Chris Wilson**: Sun chase?

[32:25] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. They are. I mean, there's, like, two small ones that either I'll have to go in there, Chris, before 4PM. I'll I'll try and get Theresa to do it, but just need to swap the hero photo out, and then swap a logo SVG out of the header and the footer, and everything else is good to go. So If Teresa can't still get on with them at

[32:48] **Chris Wilson**: No. If Teresa can't for any reason, I can go ahead and do that. But ping her and let her find out. And if she can't, let me know.

[32:54] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay. Sounds good. But, yeah, otherwise, she resolved all the comments, and we're ready to publish at 4PM today on our call.

[33:04] **Anthony Ferrara**: Music, two hour ears. Good job, everybody. One Arizona.

[33:11] **Spencer Ramirez**: Perfect. So kinda similar story here. Sid, thanks for the update with on Friday. We just had a few kind of remaining items. The most glaring that we're gonna fix here in the next, well, hour ideally Yes. Is with GA. So we just have we're just swapping out the hero image. But from a functionality standpoint, we walked through everything with the client last week. Pages are accounted for. Everything seems to be pointing to the right place.

[33:37] **Spencer Ramirez**: The only thing that's we just need to update on we're we're gonna get on we have a client call at eleven. The idea is that we need to push this live today. The only possible thing we can run into is the donate page as they've been working on swapping their payment processing over from, like, one project to a different project within their donation portal that they use or plug in that they use. The page is ready to go. The iframe's loaded. It will load whatever changes we make within the plug in.

[34:12] **Spencer Ramirez**: So we wanted to do just a tiny bit of HTML styling

[34:17] **Anthony Ferrara**: to get it a little

[34:18] **Spencer Ramirez**: bit closer to what what the website looks like now. But from a functionality standpoint, it should be working. So all that to say, we worked through the kinks outside of that, like, donation module. But, you know, they're base they're going out with this partner newsletter today, and so they really want

[34:36] **Anthony Ferrara**: to launch this site. So the

[34:37] **Spencer Ramirez**: goal is still to get on this call at eleven and push the site live. I know there's gonna be some fast follows, but that is the plan unless anybody has any other thoughts.

[34:50] **Chris Wilson**: Can you add me to that call at eleven, by the way?

[34:55] **Spencer Ramirez**: I can try. I should be able to. Perfect. I think I think I own an Alamy.

[35:02] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. Perfect. I'll just let you know, they said it was gonna be eight days minimum from the time that they are switching over their workspace for that donation portion. So it it will be what it will be. The problem is is that and now that I think about it with their old iframe and then moving to the new workspace, we just basically have to tell them, I probably would wanna hide that page. I don't know how approach it, but it's something completely out of our hands.

[35:28] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Yeah. I just think about this one as, like, what are we fixing in post? Like, message by the end of the day. Like, we've launched like two other sites with Adaceli, and she she's usually like pretty low stress on like pages being out of date for a couple days while something gets fixed. So maybe just a message of, like, we're going live at this time. Here's what's not gonna be done, and here's things we have to resolve post launch.

[36:02] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay. So, yeah, that's the plan for the call. The only thing that needs attention as well is I don't know if we need to do, like, an internal sync, but figuring out the member portal and how we're gonna solve that because, I don't know, her stance is that she paid extra for it to be something where she can have individual users. And Squarespace does not solve for that, so we need to find a solution, you know, in the next couple weeks and build that and push that live.

[36:37] **Spencer Ramirez**: But she's okay with just having a password protected page for, you know, this week, but we just need to get going on that.

[36:46] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah. I think I have two ideas here. It could either be a sub domain WordPress site, and we just use a plug in. We use the plug in for the Charo site, and it was pretty easy to set up. And we already have the designs. Theresa did it as well. So I know she could do it. Or we use a system like our partner portal, which is run on an app called mini extensions. It's way more expensive, though. So it's one of those two solutions.

[37:12] **Anthony Ferrara**: So I Chris and Chris, maybe me and you can just jam on this this afternoon and just Yeah. Put together plan. And then we we could spare you Spencer and Sydney and just kind of align on the we could propose two options for her to choose, and then we'll follow that plan. So me and let me and Chris get this one and might just need help with you guys communicating it. Okay. Empower ship launch done. Next one, bold metrics.

[37:55] **Rachel Xie**: Think we have all of the finalized deliverables. I just wanted to get someone else to take a look and make sure. Do a quick QA. And if everything looks good, I wanna send all of those out today.

[38:10] **Spencer Ramirez**: I

[38:14] **Anthony Ferrara**: feel like I feel like you're the one, Spencer, to to just thumbs it up. If it's the thumbs up, Rachel will send it. Kothari, thanks for your help. Thanks for your help on the Kevin helped with animation. Spencer, you you provided some details. It looked good. I sent it to her. I haven't heard back. So if it's approved, this one's closed out. If there's any changes, they'll be super minor. Morrison Nordman, we're still waiting for them to approve the changes that were made.

[38:55] **Anthony Ferrara**: We could talk about this more tomorrow when we meet with the possibility team. The internal possibility team was has not been made aware of this larger vision of the Morrison Nordman site. So that's what tomorrow's call is for, and we could talk more about that then. Patricia, to Loom experience. Ten thirty one, four days from now.

[39:24] **Chris Wilson**: The Martha Norman, by the way, I did update all those requests that they had so that that went out in our five sites.

[39:34] **Anthony Ferrara**: For your help on that.

[39:36] **Sydney Johnson**: Yeah. All's going good. We met with Kathleen, and we gave her a full walk through of the site. And we also introduced her to Mark. Patrick let her through a walk through. Afterwards, we told her that Chris is gonna be coming on to our call, on Wednesday. We introduced them together, and we're gonna help her set up a DNS. So that site should be finished and deployed really soon, honestly.

[40:03] **Anthony Ferrara**: Seems to be the constant response for all these sites that have been plaguing us. So that's cool to hear. Yeah. I don't have anything there. Like, the goal for sure is that we don't host anything. Like, they set it up in their environment. And once we close this out, maybe there's a opportunity to upsell Andrew, but not until we launch. AZA, Rachel.

[40:33] **Rachel Xie**: I had a quick sync with Aaron last week. We just kinda confirm on items that he still needs to update, and he's just gonna go in to WordPress and update them himself. And then, yeah, I think we'll just have to follow-up with him to remind him, man, like, to update finish updating everything. Other than that, there's nothing else left for Xie.

[41:03] **Anthony Ferrara**: Have you in Chris synced at all with the launch plan or DNS stuff?

[41:09] **Rachel Xie**: No. We haven't.

[41:11] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. We might let's add that to our agenda, Chris, and I'll inform you where it's at. We might pull you and Rachel for, like, fifteen minutes just to think that all the way through to the end.

[41:26] **Spencer Ramirez**: Which client was that again?

[41:28] **Anthony Ferrara**: AZA United. It's a non autism nonprofit. Perfect. Cool. Iron and Kin, anything to discuss there?

[41:45] **Chris Wilson**: They basically have everything ready to go. They just draw me content

[41:49] **Spencer Ramirez**: for the store. Yeah. So kinda same thing. A little bit similar to Piper. We gave them, everything that we kinda needed to to fulfill. So they have the website. It's in their hands. Card is done. I mean, we're functionally done with the website. We're around to assist. We've given them all the collateral that we needed to, to fulfill the scope. Tie tiny bit going back and forth on this menu stuff, but it's it's very low stakes right now on that project.

[42:22] **Spencer Ramirez**: So, yeah, just you know, we'll probably I think we told them that this will be our last, weekly, and then they can just schedule calls with us when when needed as they start to get samples in for the packaging,

[42:35] **Anthony Ferrara**: start to get some

[42:35] **Spencer Ramirez**: of that lifestyle photography, product photography up, and work. You know, just let them know we're around to assist if and when needed, but otherwise, we are fulfilled. So

[42:46] **Anthony Ferrara**: So it's safe to say, like, the site is built functionally complete. They need to populate it. Yep. Them.

[42:53] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yep.

[42:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: And we can close it out like this one. Can we close it out today? Is there anything that we're

[43:01] **Spencer Ramirez**: approved? I I don't know. Karen, did they approve the menu stuff yet, or are we still going back and forth on that if any bit?

[43:09] **Nohar Wahnishe**: We're still going back and forth on that, but I think I should send I could send them over and see how they feel about it or if you want me.

[43:17] **Spencer Ramirez**: I I think we should wait till Friday because that's our date, Anthony, is the thirty first, and just close it out then.

[43:23] **Nohar Wahnishe**: Yeah.

[43:24] **Anthony Ferrara**: Sounds good. Alright. Going into retainers. That's closing out this week.

[43:36] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. No new updates. I've been keeping an eye on the teams. Message Brandy this morning to see if there was gonna be a meeting. Haven't heard back from her. So assuming that we won't be having our sync today. But, yeah, I'll be checking the teams all week, while Joe's out.

[43:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: If you could, just proactively remind her, hey, we're closing this out Friday. Is there anything that you need from us? As of Friday, 5PM, we will no longer be checking this. Just wanna make sure you're in, like, a good spot.

[44:10] **Chris Wilson**: Okay. Got it. Will do.

[44:14] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. So I'm gonna close that out. But pending a response to that message, Optimize done. One second. Do you need anything on Project Pros this week, Rachel? I feel like we had a good session before I left.

[44:40] **Rachel Xie**: Yeah. Yeah. Since we we we canceled the Thursday meetings since we had this met on Tuesday, we sent, like, an update over Loom. We have kind of, like, all the high fidelity, like, kind of, like, template pages done. I'm working on some professions this week and then updating and copying content into it for them to see.

[45:08] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Sounds good. Yeah. Once design's approved, we gotta get developer involved. Mhmm. Most likely most likely, Teresa after she closes out everything that she's working on now. Skipping Walmart because I think Natalie has a call. Talked about LinkedIn. Anything on Shiloh?

[45:37] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. We wrapped up sprint 17 last week, and so we fulfilled our one and a half sprint, of product for the month of October. However, due to their Zillow conference that's starting next Monday through, I believe, Wednesday, which I think they're really busy preparing for, we did offer, the half sprint for November, to be done this week instead. And so November's allotment will take place this week. We're having a kickoff call today. And spoke to Andrew and, I think, Joe in the channel.

[46:12] **Chris Wilson**: Andrew, I believe it's just documenting very clearly that the half sprint for the product or for November's allotment has been addressed right now. Right?

[46:22] **Chris Wilson**: And just

[46:22] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yep. Yep.

[46:24] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. Okay. So yeah. So we'll be working on yeah. Just any last minute things that they need wrapped up ahead of their Zillow conference next week.

[46:37] **Anthony Ferrara**: And I know we delivered the banner. I think there's, like, two pieces of collateral. Did we hit that as well for October?

[46:46] **Chris Wilson**: To my knowledge, I don't think there was anything else. So I don't I Yeah. Yeah. I don't think we yeah.

[46:52] **Spencer Ramirez**: They haven't sent anything? They haven't been using the retainer fully?

[46:58] **Anthony Ferrara**: I say we just use the blog for that. It's two pages. If you if you disagree, Andrew, let me know and we could chat about it. But

[47:09] **Andrew Smyth**: No. Yeah. Let's do it.

[47:11] **Anthony Ferrara**: So whoever's working on the blog, I would just say, let's get that into production. Archive page, individual page, desktop, mobile based on the current design of the new site. So, Patrick, do you you got that covered? And feel free to to ask for help if you need to focus on the product design stuff.

[47:39] **Chris Wilson**: Yeah. I may need to sync with Spencer on that. I haven't worked on the website at all. So, yeah, I can sync with either Spencer or with Natalie, whoever was working on the blog designs originally. But

[47:53] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. Nobody nobody we haven't touched it at all yet, but we just did a landing page. That was all a typo, but we can I can give you an update? We can find fifteen minutes and just catch up on it.

[48:06] **Chris Wilson**: Okay. Sounds good.

[48:08] **Anthony Ferrara**: And permission to make massive assumptions on, like, categories and tags. Yeah. Think it'd be better if they just have something to react to archive page, single page.

[48:20] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. Like, now they only have three blog posts and two of them are the same post. So it really affected they have two blog posts right now?

[48:28] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah. CrowdStrike, I have an update there. Rachel, I have a call in thirty minutes with the team to get an update on where we're at with onboarding. Thank you for producing style tiles. I'll have an update for you very shortly. But that will ramp up every week that goes by. And we got officially approved for thirty hours a week. So that's a pretty heavy retainer that will replace upper moray in a big way. So we'll definitely need more support than just me and Rachel.

[49:06] **Anthony Ferrara**: The plan is to get Justin, Joe, Rachel, and myself access for now and more if needed. But we'll go from there. Sheer ID, anything that we're working on there? I know you're doing sales stuff, Andrew. We can talk about that later.

[49:28] **Rachel Xie**: Nothing for design. I think there's some dev related work for Kyle Groove right now.

[49:39] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Triple lift. Natalie's not here. I'll sync with her later. Shrink space.

[49:50] **Chris Wilson**: No. No new updates at this time.

[49:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: Telly? Not

[50:00] **Sydney Johnson**: much going on with Telly right now. It's really been a pretty slow week, but we are still confirmed for a meeting right after this. So

[50:09] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. Dallas is an unhappy person.

[50:14] **Sydney Johnson**: It's yeah. That that happened last week. That was something. But, hopefully, he'll be better this week.

[50:23] **Anthony Ferrara**: Well, if we need to huddle on that today, I'm available today. Okay.

[50:29] **Sydney Johnson**: Sounds good. Lauren did a pretty good job at responding back. So as well as Andrew too. I know Andrew talked to him on the side as well. So

[50:37] **Andrew Smyth**: No. I didn't talk to him on the side. I'm gonna talk to

[50:39] **Anthony Ferrara**: him on

[50:39] **Chris Wilson**: the call.

[50:40] **Sydney Johnson**: Oh, okay. See? And that's that's what we need.

[50:43] **Rachel Xie**: So

[50:43] **Sydney Johnson**: perfect. So yeah. We have still have a meeting there, and there's work probably coming this week.

[50:52] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Well, yeah. My ears are perked up on that one. So let me know how I can help. State of Arizona, Nohar, I this is the week fully. I know exactly what we're doing. I synced with the team, and I have a very clear road map. I do not want to bother you since enroll enrolls should be the focus to just close it out. So I'll set some can we set thirty minutes so that I can just update you? It could be today. It could be, like, around lunchtime tomorrow.

[51:26] **Anthony Ferrara**: But I just wanna download you on where we're at. That one will replace enroll almost immediately. So wanted to get a sense of your schedule and then just download you on the requirements. Andrew, so you know, a Nebbe took a new job. This is you can't, like, talk about it to anyone but a Nebbe, but he just got the same position at the state of Colorado.

[51:54] **Andrew Smyth**: Random. Okay.

[51:57] **Anthony Ferrara**: Texting me, and he's, like, gonna try to bring us in there too.

[52:00] **Chris Wilson**: How does that happen? Didn't write

[52:02] **Spencer Ramirez**: Did he move to Colorado?

[52:04] **Anthony Ferrara**: He's been trying to move to Colorado for, like, three years.

[52:06] **Andrew Smyth**: Oh, good for him. Great. Alright.

[52:13] **Anthony Ferrara**: I think that's it. Everything else is web support stuff. Chris, the goal of mine is to get you onboarded to Oxy support so that you know how when we close all these nine sites that we're finishing, how we can better I think, Andrew, you should probably be there too. We have a tons of projects that are just on autopilot that we make money on just WordPress sites that get supported. We're launching a bunch of WordPress sites. We don't do a good job of, like, upselling them once they're closed.

[52:48] **Anthony Ferrara**: So I'll talk to you guys about that maybe late this week. But, yeah, anything we did not cover, anything you guys are worried about heading into this week before I move on?

[53:08] **Chris Wilson**: No. Think it's all good.

[53:11] **Anthony Ferrara**: Well, that is the best deploy update I've ever gotten in my life. Let's close these out. Let's move on. Let's work on internal stuff, starting next week. And, Spencer, I hope your life gets a lot easier after this week. Because that's a lot of updates to give in a call. And, Chris, thanks for all your support, and we'll get to the finish line on this. Okay. So last thing to close out. Yeah. Joe is out this week. He comes back on Monday. I believe Spencer will have some PTO next week.

[53:47] **Anthony Ferrara**: So it'll be a busy week to launch these sites. Sid, I think you should really you and Spencer really gotta sync to make sure that things are covered next week. And me and Spencer are going to be pretty tied up tomorrow and Wednesday. In a session, we'll be able to break away if needed. We're not, like, on a horse in the middle of nowhere like I was last year or last week. But but cool.

[54:19] **Anthony Ferrara**: The last thing I wanted to say, saw it I read a blog post this week on the word agency, and I've been really obsessing over this word. And it seems like the Internet is now catching up to my wavelength on this. But I wanted to read something. Let me find it. So there's this concept of agency, and agency is a we are a design agency. But I also think the word agent and agency is, like, always been interesting to me.

[54:58] **Anthony Ferrara**: It's, like, in the context of, like, a personality trait, it refers to, like, an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It's about being proactive rather than reactive. Someone with high agency doesn't just let life happen to them. They shape it. Think of it as a blend of self efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one's path. People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence even in the face of obstacles.

[55:35] **Anthony Ferrara**: They're the type to say, I'll figure it out, and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone with low agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces like luck, other people, or circumstances to dictate what happens next. It's not the same thing as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is much quieter, more internal. It's the belief that you can act paired with the will to follow through. And I loved I loved that.

[56:07] **Anthony Ferrara**: I saw a whole tweet storm on the word agency being more important than intelligence or experience. And it's something that I really drive to instill in myself and our team, and we are a design agency. Doesn't just mean we're a collective of people trying to work for other people. It's just that we figure things out in the face of obstacles, and you've all done that over the last couple months. We have our team is growing, and I think we have an incredibly amount of smart people here.

[56:40] **Anthony Ferrara**: And to add to the list, I wanted to officially announce that Chris Wilson has accepted a full time role, and he will help us moving forward on product strategy as our director of products. The days of terrible deploys are over. We got someone with gray hair, not just me on the team, and I'm really excited. Chris' experience is vast. Carvana, GoDaddy, Infusionsoft, he's an entrepreneur. He can build a house with his bare hands, and he's a good guy. And I hope he's made your guys' life easier, and he will continue to do so.

[57:21] **Anthony Ferrara**: Reach out to him. He's a helpful person. He's a father of four. He's taught me a lot myself, so I'm really excited to have him on the team. And you guys have support, so don't suffer in silence. Chris has a lot to share. If you wanna learn about building a house, we're speaking Spanish. We no longer have one person that speaks Spanish on the team, Karen. So I'm really excited. He's gonna teach us a lot. And thank you, Chris. Excited for more to come.

[57:54] **Chris Wilson**: Thank you. Thanks for having me, guys. I'm excited. And like Anthony said, if you need help or support in anything, let me know. And ideally, in the very short term, we wanna get Anthony out of all things technical. So as we move forward, I still might need some ramp up time with different projects, but, hopefully, it'll go pretty quick.

[58:13] **Anthony Ferrara**: And just so you know, he's been doing everything he's been doing on, like, ten hours a week. So times it by four and think about what you hate doing, don't know how to do, or haven't learned yet. And find ways where Chris can help support you or train you up on anything products, web development. We'll we'll figure out exactly how to best utilize them in certain projects. But, yeah, really excited about that. So I hope you guys have a great week. I know you guys gotta get to telly. Reach out if you need help.

[58:48] **Chris Wilson**: Hey, guys.

[58:49] **Rachel Xie**: Thank you.

[58:50] **Anthony Ferrara**: Thanks, everybody.

[58:51] **Andrew Smyth**: Thank you. Welcome, Chris. See you, guys.
