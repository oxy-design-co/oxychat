[0:01] **Spencer Ramirez**: And it seems like

[0:02] **Andrew Smyth**: Gotcha. Yeah.

[0:04] **Spencer Ramirez**: Just getting the thoughts out. You know? Yep. But feels good. Feels good to be back in an office. Good. Yeah.

[0:19] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. I'm excited what you guys

[0:23] **Spencer Ramirez**: get out of it. Yeah.

[0:25] **Andrew Smyth**: I'm excited to see the results. Me too.

[0:31] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yo. Hey.

[0:34] **Andrew Smyth**: What's going on?

[0:36] **Maksym Zaselian**: Everything fine. We'll wait for Jenna.

[0:41] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay.

[0:42] **Maksym Zaselian**: And I hope it's enough.

[0:46] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. This meeting is being recorded.

[0:53] **Maksym Zaselian**: Thank you.

[0:54] **Spencer Ramirez**: What do you guys like to use for a notetaker? Actually, I don't know. Oh, okay.

[1:02] **Maksym Zaselian**: I think Ask Elephant. Don't know.

[1:06] **Spencer Ramirez**: We've tried almost all of them at this point. Yeah. So always like to to see what people are using.

[1:16] **Maksym Zaselian**: Circle Circleback is pretty convenient. Actually, it looks good.

[1:20] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah. We like Circleback. We love it. All of our testing.

[2:29] **Andrew Smyth**: Spencer, probably, wait wait. Quick question for you just like with an Oxy thing. What's a good, like, style tile reference to send to someone new of, like, what a style tile is.

[2:46] **Spencer Ramirez**: I mean, we have a well, like, we have a template that kind of explains it, but there's no real visual on attached to that. Probably TripleLift.

[3:18] **Andrew Smyth**: Oh, yeah. That'd be good.

[3:21] **Spencer Ramirez**: There's a recent one. One in Arizona. And are they in so they'd be in So they're either in their own file, like, project name style tiles, or if not, then it'll be in the marketing website folder as a page inside of

[3:50] **Andrew Smyth**: oh, yeah. Here we go. Okay. Style tiles. 1.media.

[3:57] **Spencer Ramirez**: Sweet.

[4:03] **Andrew Smyth**: Okay. So it's, like, kinda like a style guide.

[4:06] **Spencer Ramirez**: It is the first fold of a website. So it's right up to the mood board, and it's after we define decide on, like, a kinda single concept or vision, as far as, like, general colors, typography choices. Once we make all those decisions on the mood board, visual elements, then we move into the style tile, which is three distinct concepts. It's just the first full of the website. So the first thing that you see. Got it. Thank you. Mhmm.

[4:52] **Maksym Zaselian**: I hope Jenna I don't know. Where is she? Yeah. They're coming.

[5:04] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay.

[5:10] **Andrew Smyth**: Slack presented me with some, like, Halloween UI options. I don't know if you guys got BingNet too, but it's pretty fun.

[5:20] **Spencer Ramirez**: That's funny.

[5:21] **Andrew Smyth**: So my status is working.

[5:25] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay. I saw that, and I was I thought that was I thought you cooked that up. And I was like, what is he doing all night? Like, what are you grinding on till the October or the end of Halloween? No. I get it. That's really funny.

[5:48] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. I just changed my Slack from, like, orange, like, a Sun Valley orange, like, a sunburst orange to blue. And, like, it feels like I'm working at a different company. It's like I don't know. Just trying to join little things, I guess.

[6:10] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yes. For sure.

[6:14] **Andrew Smyth**: Highly recommend that everyone change their Slack colors every once in a while.

[6:20] **Spencer Ramirez**: They have a lot. They they have a lot of options. Hey. It's Thursday.

[6:32] **Andrew Smyth**: The gang's all here.

[6:34] **Jenna Bayler**: Sorry.

[6:37] **Spencer Ramirez**: No problem. All good. Hello.

[6:42] **Jenna Bayler**: Hello.

[6:43] **Spencer Ramirez**: Cool. Alright. So October 28, we are a few days out from the original deadline that we set out. So at the end of that, goal is, you know, finalize brand, finalize brand guide, template presentation templates, 10 slides, and some social media social media templates as well. Yeah. We're tracking really well. You know, biggest thing is continuing to iterate on just the logo mark itself. We've done, as we know, a lot of good work on the brand to get that to a good spot. So I figured we're gonna take it.

[7:25] **Spencer Ramirez**: I mean, I know we have the agenda set, but I think from that, we will go over the recent logos from the last week, and then we can look at some of the presentation slides and go from there. So yeah. I'm sure everybody had a chance to look. This first first step we're gonna look at here are the iterations that we're technically we can call version three point o three, so an extension of that third round third version of the third round.

[8:03] **Spencer Ramirez**: So still trying to keep more of the beads and and rods connectivity that we've seen in the brand. Try them out in a few different ways, a little bit more circular. That one's interesting. So we have yeah. Eight or, no, eight. 10 options here, and then we have our fourth iteration. So new logos, new logo concepts, a little bit more. So this is just kind of the joining of the the beads to create the s. The s inside here, kind of reminiscent to the old. Bit of an extraction abstraction application.

[9:23] **Spencer Ramirez**: So using circles two half circles and then the one rod and two beads, which could be interesting. You know? Soraban and the user connect by a rod, and the s around it. Similar but with two. So this kind of this one has, like, pretty much everything we've explored. So you have the s clearly defined. You have the beads and, you know, rods in between, and then you have them making the star in the center. An s that is very clearly to. And so those are six explorations. So we have 10 here.

[10:26] **Spencer Ramirez**: They're all in the same, and then we have six new ones. So, yeah, I'll open this up for feedback, and we'll see over liking. Are we deciding now?

[10:44] **Jenna Bayler**: We don't have to. No.

[10:45] **Spencer Ramirez**: You don't have to. I'm just we're so we're just talking about it now. Just showing you kinda, you know, using this time to go over it. If you had if you had a chance to look or not, you know, happy to collect feedback now or async. You want some time to think about that?

[11:04] **Jenna Bayler**: Definitely had a chance to look.

[11:06] **Spencer Ramirez**: K.

[11:10] **Jenna Bayler**: Interestingly, we did, like, a vote with some of like, the leadership team in between the original, like, diamond shape

[11:20] **Spencer Ramirez**: Right.

[11:21] **Jenna Bayler**: And the we're calling it the sphere, which is just like that, but with the little dots around it. Yep. I don't I was liking the sphere, but they all chose the diamond. We're gonna kinda dig into why.

[11:35] **Spencer Ramirez**: Cool. Let's dig into it.

[11:39] **Jenna Bayler**: Like, no. No. Like, I don't know why. We're gonna ask them later. And then I really liked in the new the new set, the second one. Yeah. I was digging that one.

[11:54] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yep.

[11:57] **Jenna Bayler**: I think the third one reminded us too much of and I know I, like, really proposed that one. Reminded us too much of Medium.

[12:05] **Spencer Ramirez**: Medium? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good call. I see. And as soon as you said that, was like, damn.

[12:11] **Jenna Bayler**: It was Max. He found it. I didn't know. You could have fooled me. And the first one, I think, Max, you made something similar, but I kinda like that one too.

[12:28] **Spencer Ramirez**: Mhmm. And Yeah. This yeah. This one kind of reminiscent of that first version. I think we had something similar, you know Yeah. In our earlier explorations.

[12:41] **Jenna Bayler**: I didn't see the s until you called that out on the

[12:46] **Spencer Ramirez**: I know it's

[12:46] **Jenna Bayler**: good, but I like that.

[12:49] **Spencer Ramirez**: Let's see. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Yep. There we go. Okay. So this is a possible yeah. It's it's that's strong. I like I like option two here. So we can let's see. That's good. I mean, overall, what's staying with the brand is this kind of connectivity between the

[13:20] **Jenna Bayler**: You don't like this one at all? Alright. That's a no.

[13:23] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay. Cool.

[13:24] **Maksym Zaselian**: I mean, it's just that I'm Like, a chemical thing. You know? Some bulbs.

[13:33] **Spencer Ramirez**: Oh, then and I I mean, you know, that's good. We're getting closer. So, you know, between this and this, they're they're pretty similar. It's just about the surrounding. We really just added some dots here on the outskirts to make it a little bit more balanced. But

[13:54] **Maksym Zaselian**: I like this one.

[13:56] **Spencer Ramirez**: Yeah.

[13:57] **Maksym Zaselian**: Deals. And this one. Yeah. So it's it's at least one second place in my list, and this one is the first one.

[14:05] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay. Good to know. Cool. Well, I mean, in general, you know, swapping out the surfaces is not that huge of a deal swapping out the logo mark itself. So as long as we can make a decision in the last in the next couple days, that would be awesome just so we can make sure we update, you know, all the documents that we're gonna provide you with and then export the right stuff. So, yeah, you don't need to make a decision on the call, but just, you know, maybe take a little bit of time.

[14:40] **Spencer Ramirez**: You can grill the team about why why Diamond versus circular. I guess if, you know, if if I wanted to inject 2Â¢ real quick, there might be more there might be more of a use with something circular in the in the product itself.

[15:03] **Spencer Ramirez**: You know, if you ever wanted to build out kind of, like, you know, similar to ChatGPT or something, how they have the kind of voice button that's circular, and then you can, like or a lot of apps kinda have it right in the center for that kind of using the logo as also the agent, if you will.

[15:22] **Spencer Ramirez**: So, you know, if that's someone in the road map, this lends well to being a little bit more modular to when, like, you know, I could see this easily animating to a voice, right, if you have that kind of interaction within the app. So my 2Â¢ would be between these two. This on a like, a just from, like, a a marketing standpoint might, you know, set you a little bit more apart than the other one, but I do think that this probably has a wider use in the product, I had to say.

[16:01] **Spencer Ramirez**: So that's my take. Cool. Alright. Well, with that, I wanted to just, like we're we're iterating on the slides that you had asked us to prepare. So we're starting to put the brand together in different applications throughout use. So, you know, how can we really, on the presentations, use white space, continue to bring in these elements that we've defined.

[16:38] **Spencer Ramirez**: This is interesting because and, I mean, how it probably changes, I think I think we probably need to use more use more of this blue gradient to kind of bring some more depth and not not have it so kinda flat. But, overall, I think I think we're definitely getting there. I think the the colors are working together pretty well. It looks very enterprise and professional, which is the goal with this surface at least versus some of the others, whereas social media, we're using a lot more blue.

[17:13] **Spencer Ramirez**: I think for this instance, it does make sense to use more white. But I do think we could use more of the gradient within the some of this iconography and not make it so flat blue and green. But, yeah, we have, like, at least two more rounds on this before, you know, we confident confidently deliver, but you can kinda see how you can use, you know, use these shapes that are within the logo to kinda come in and out of a slide. So kinda dynamic there. I really like the use of this gradient and circle.

[17:52] **Spencer Ramirez**: You know, you're not gonna see you don't have that, like, kinda search bar gradient that I know you like, Jenna, but for the surface, that's not really not really needed. But, yeah, just wanted to kinda show you our progress so far. We're gonna continue working on this over the next couple days, but I'll pass this along too. You guys can just, like, continue to comment what you like or hate as we get down to it.

[18:22] **Spencer Ramirez**: And then once we kinda get to a good spot, ideally, in the next, you know, forty eight, seventy two hours with this, we can go ahead and translate it over to we open for our what whatever whatever you had said, Jenna, that you like to use for slides, we'll make sure to optimize it for that.

[18:43] **Spencer Ramirez**: And give me the Figma file and then also

[18:47] **Jenna Bayler**: PowerPoint. I don't know if I actually like to use it.

[18:51] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah.

[18:51] **Spencer Ramirez**: I don't

[18:51] **Jenna Bayler**: know if we go that far.

[18:54] **Spencer Ramirez**: Well, that's yeah. Yeah. That's the thing. It's definitely gotta gotta work for both. So, yeah, we'll build it on Google Slides as well, these slides, once they're ready to go. But, yeah, just wanted to show you kind of our progress there.

[19:05] **Jenna Bayler**: I do still have quite a bit of beef with the three giant circles.

[19:11] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay. Yeah. Let's look at where we were at. Kinda version four. No. Wait. Version three zero two. Okay. Yep. Understood.

[19:33] **Jenna Bayler**: As one? I don't mind it. Yeah. Okay. As three.

[19:47] **Spencer Ramirez**: Okay. Cool. Okay. Yeah. So other than that let's see. Once we kinda get the decision on the logo, we can start to package that up. I will yeah. We can revise all of these surfaces already just based on that feedback of revising these three circles as they're used pretty prominently. So we'll figure out a solve for that on these services. We'll update that over the next forty eight hours. And, yeah, like I said, I still have a couple rounds to go probably with these slides, but do want your feedback ongoing as we get through it.

[20:43] **Spencer Ramirez**: So I'll send you this link, and you guys can check it out. Yeah. So, again, goal is to kinda have, you know, this firmed up by the end of the week, and then we can start to go in on the few things that we're thinking about adding after this. Great. So yeah. Overall, though, tracking well, you know, but we'd love to open up to you guys as well. Our our we're getting towards this deadline. You know, I know we're kind of in the nitty gritty now. So, overall, gut check. How's the team feeling?

[21:20] **Spencer Ramirez**: Anything we can we can help out within the next few days as well beyond what we're talking about to, you know, give you guys some confidence with this. Let me know.

[21:31] **Jenna Bayler**: I'm feeling good. Max, any thoughts?

[21:36] **Maksym Zaselian**: No. Good.

[21:38] **Spencer Ramirez**: This is good. This is a good point of the project where we're, like, getting comfortable with it, seeing it every week. Now it's like, yep. All good. So cool. That's what we like to hear. Awesome. Any questions for us for the next few days while we kinda grind this one out? Easy. Andrew, anything on your end? One

[22:05] **Andrew Smyth**: thing. I sent the addendum estimate over for the logo animations and that net new.

[22:13] **Jenna Bayler**: I think we are gonna pass on the logo animations, but probably move forward with the rest.

[22:20] **Spencer Ramirez**: Cool. Awesome. Well, how'd you guys hammer that out? Sid, anything on your end? Nope? Awesome.

[22:29] **Jenna Bayler**: I'll go to my end.

[22:30] **Spencer Ramirez**: Alright. Well, yeah, this is this is going well. So awesome. I appreciate the time as always. Jenna, Max, hit hit us up if you need anything, but we'll give you updates, you know, periodically throughout the week and work towards kinda Thursday, Friday as when we start to to hand things off. So very exciting.

[22:49] **Jenna Bayler**: Cool. Thank you, guys.

[22:51] **Spencer Ramirez**: Awesome. Thank you so much. Have a good one. Bye.
