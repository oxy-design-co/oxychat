# Oxy Internal Sales Planning
**Date**: Tuesday, October 28, 2025 at 11:30 AM  
**Duration**: 33:08  
**People**: Andrew Smyth, Anthony Ferrara, Spencer Ramirez, and Joe Maxwell

[2:08] **Andrew Smyth**: What's good?

[2:11] **Anthony Ferrara**: Toby's flying in, Brendan Spencer coming here soon. Sorry we had to wait.

[2:17] **Andrew Smyth**: That took us two days. I'm sure you're pumped. I guess like good core design work.

[2:24] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, kind of stressful because there's like balls I gotta jump out of, but yeah, it'll be fun. How do you think Craig went yesterday? He's an interesting guy.

[2:35] **Andrew Smyth**: He's a really interesting guy. He reminds me of another guy now here. He's a little younger. But like, yeah, like there's like this new, we mentioned like men's shame cycles. I'm sure there's a lot of good information like from that, but it just rang a couple thousand. And I like, I talked to who used to work at Airbnb. I don't know, it's interesting, but I think he's like has great ideas. Like he's just trying to grapple with it all and something he's got some cool investors and a cool network.

[3:03] **Anthony Ferrara**: So.

[3:05] **Andrew Smyth**: Fingers crossed. I think I'd go really well with Anthony Ronga. It's like a perfect introduction, but I don't know.

[3:13] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah. I just have no sense of like what is affordable to him because he's like running in circles with Will Smith and LeBron James and really he's wealthy. I don't know. If I had a million, if I had two, three, four, five, 10 million dollars, I'd be like, everything's in my budget if I really want to do this. Like, I don't understand rich guys sometimes.

[3:38] **Andrew Smyth**: I agree. Yeah, that sounds really cheap. I don't know.

[3:41] **Anthony Ferrara**: I mean, yeah.

[3:43] **Andrew Smyth**: And like, his wife's still were, I don't know. Anyways, a funny note. I thought it was, it's interesting when a guy's, when anyone's profile picture or presentation, like, portrait is from, like, 30 years ago. Like, his is, like, a black and white from, like, 30 years ago. He's, like, on some set.

[4:07] **Anthony Ferrara**: Weird. It looks kind of young.

[4:12] **Andrew Smyth**: You'll see it. Like, you'll see, like, I'll get on a call, and this guy's, like, big and fat, and, like, it's, like, some skinny, like, you know, Finance bro, you know? Like, it's like, oh, who's this? Anyways.

[4:26] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, with him, I. He's clearly very excited and thinking about stuff and I'm like, I feel like our only goal is we should share what we're working on that's similar and be honest about what we don't know. I don't know shit about avatars, so I was like, Nope, don't know anything about that. And I don't know, I was kind of surprised he came back. But yeah, Shylo is really important. They're a huge referral partner.

[4:56] **Anthony Ferrara**: That's what I was, that's kind of what motivated Chris coming on is like bring me up truly to like nurture these relationships, spend more time in sales and he's already doing that. So him and I talked a lot, but I think he's gonna free me up a ton to be like more focused.

[5:19] **Andrew Smyth**: Awesome, man. I think that's great. Yeah, there's you, yeah. Your best use of your time might not be in the weeds of fixing small, you know, coding issues or website issues or deployment issues or whatever and just iterating on that until they're happy. That's probably the best use of your time.

[5:42] **Anthony Ferrara**: That's the goal, dude. But probably through the rest of the year, get him take everything off my plate and then hit January really hard. But we still gotta close a lot of deals. So excited to talk about this stuff. It is becoming more of my focus after I feel like once a month I have to kind of get LinkedIn on a straight path. That's what I'm doing today. And then. And you just like let them go for a while.

[6:16] **Andrew Smyth**: Nice. Awesome, man. Let's get into it.

[6:20] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Well, yeah, let's go through your list. I just dumped everything that was on my mind in that DM.

[6:28] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, I got that. So thanks. The possibility stuff and CTO stuff, I sort of noted that we talked about this just like a random thing. I mean, yeah, I can show up. This elephunt event in like a bomber jacket and just be like, oh, I know, wherever that designer's name is like, I'm friends with whatever, you know?

[6:52] **Anthony Ferrara**: I have a couple pointers for you there. I got introduced to them by, I honestly would have probably never knew about them if it wasn't for my old roommate. Moved to LA, he's like a big photographer guy. That's how I kind of also met Spencer and Joe.

[7:10] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, cool.

[7:12] **Anthony Ferrara**: So he's just tapped into, like, fashion guys, photography guys that run in agency circles in La. And I think I'll give you a couple notes if you actually go to that, but those guys are killing it. They have an interesting model where they just brought together a ton of, like, really good, like a ton of me's basically that were doing their own thing, killing it in freelance. And then they partnered up and they all are capable of bringing in their own leads, executing design work, and they've all worked at much bigger agencies.

[7:49] **Anthony Ferrara**: There's this one agency called Basic in San Diego that crushed it and they sold this some international conglomerate and the guy owns he moved to, like, Las Vegas to avoid taxes when he sold it. And, like, a lot of them used to work there, but I'll give you some pointers if you actually go to, like, for conversation stuff. But it's a bunch of, like, dead-eyed cool kids. Yeah. That are, like, but they're doing for, like, Nike, coinbase, the NBA. Like, they're kind of doing all the stuff that I want to.

[8:26] **Anthony Ferrara**: Get, but I don't know how to get in Phoenix. And I. I think they're crushing it, but they're much more like capital a artists than. Yeah, Tech guys. They don't do any product. They only do, like, brand and marketing, but they're starting to. And some of the stuff I've seen is pretty cool.

[8:46] **Andrew Smyth**: Sick.

[8:46] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah.

[8:47] **Andrew Smyth**: I would love to go and try it out, so we'll see. Sammy's in pointers.

[8:55] **Anthony Ferrara**: That's a cool restaurant too, if you've never been.

[8:57] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, so that's where he went with ARM.

[8:59] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, apparently, like I met the owner, he invested a bunch of money. Sick. ARM's just a weirdo. Like, I still don't even know how he makes money, payment processing or something.

[9:12] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, okay. Sick. Don Fosch, this name definitely rings a bell. You mentioned it before. So is he back in town or something or just the Nerd Network is I heard the Nerd Network. What's more context on Don?

[9:31] **Anthony Ferrara**: Former Apple, former PayPal, rich guy, Paradise Valley, Christian guy. We vibed on so many levels every time I met. I think you wrote a scope of work when we were trying to do the pro bono thing. And then I don't know, he never emailed us back. And then we were talking to some guy that helps him put on the event who I know and I saw at CES. I think he just got freaked out by the whole like, here's the value. He's like, oh, a contract. I thought you were helping us out.

[10:05] **Anthony Ferrara**: And then he's like very like values based economy. But you've seen like we do this free work and it like doesn't turn into anything. So I just have to even for Tax purposes assign a value to it so he could write it off. Yeah. And he wasn't, if he wasn't willing to sign it, I wasn't willing to work with him. But Arizona Nerd Networks happening this Saturday, Chris, one thing to have in the back of your head, if there's events, Chris will go. Chris is like, he's like, I wanna help grow this.

[10:38] **Anthony Ferrara**: Like he, part of his comp was tied to milestones. Okay, so he's taking a big pay cut to work with us. He like rejected GoDaddy to work with us. Okay. So his big goal is to get us to 4 million. That's his kicker where he's like making as much as he was at his last gig. So part of that, I'm like, you're gonna need to like go to events. I can't go to events. I'm having another kid. Like I've, I have zero time.

[11:10] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah.

[11:10] **Anthony Ferrara**: And he's brought in sales before, so he's gonna try to go this Saturday.

[11:16] **Andrew Smyth**: Sweet.

[11:16] **Anthony Ferrara**: I'm gonna try to go this Saturday. I've never been, but it's the biggest group of, like, hackers, hackathon stuff. They just buy Costco pizza and just get a bunch of nerds in a room. And some pretty big startups have been spun out of it out here. Cool. There's a lot of. Energy with like all the big semiconductor factories are here. And it's still growing at like an insane rate. Yeah. So that's like we just need to have a presence in every major serious event that's going on.

[11:58] **Anthony Ferrara**: And we already got introduced to this guy and this guy has access to VC networks and like, I really like him, but he just, I always use that like Trojan horse of like, let us do the branding, let us do the site and yeah, and one that's very similar to that is that press comp, Wonderland Curious. We met with her yesterday. We launched her new site.

[12:21] **Andrew Smyth**: Nice.

[12:22] **Anthony Ferrara**: And I'm speaking at the event. So I got him a ticket. But yeah, as part of our sales strategy, we can deploy Chris to things in Phoenix.

[12:37] **Andrew Smyth**: Nice. On press conf, so we printed, she printed little cards about Oxy, and it was in everyone's goodie bag, and nothing came from it. So just letting you know.

[12:52] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, 'cause I wasn't there.

[12:54] **Andrew Smyth**: Yes, they were like, what the heck is this? So I think we, I think we'll do something like that again, but I've seen to get custom.

[13:01] **Anthony Ferrara**: She told us she's gonna put our logo on the site, on the banners, right?

[13:05] **Andrew Smyth**: On the sponsorship stuff. If you're speaking that, every, anytime you speak, like you always have those Excel spreadsheets of people that scan the QR code or whatever, so.

[13:15] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah.

[13:16] **Andrew Smyth**: All right.

[13:18] **Anthony Ferrara**: So I just add that to the list, like Press Conf, Wonderland Curious Planning, it's in April. I'm working on my speech. I'm going to be there. We got to get the logo added. Might need to reach out to her to send her the logo and be like that kind of thing.

[13:35] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, it'd be nice to have that done by the end of the year because last time it was so last minute. So it was kind of crazy. Yeah. Oxy support. Yeah. Thanks for scheduling that time. Yeah, I always, every month I do some AI work and then like, so this is a 31 page report based on the last four weekly internals. It takes all the notes. Then I read through this and then I make my own hit list of top 10. I was like upsells and stuff.

[14:18] **Andrew Smyth**: So I'll socialize this on Thursday and then make sure we're doing like the handoff like correctly and like scheduling the meeting and being like, it's not about upselling, it's about like reviewing the project, how to go and then if it goes well, you know, all that stuff. Just to make sure everyone's on the same page. Because every interaction matters. So I just wanted to point that out. Thanks for scheduling that and being proactive. Yeah, our ride book. I have some hold time for us on Friday.

[14:55] **Anthony Ferrara**: I gotta just take pictures of it like I did last time.

[14:58] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. Did you meet that one guy?

[15:02] **Anthony Ferrara**: Dude, I couldn't find him anywhere legitimately.

[15:06] **Andrew Smyth**: You have like a headshot in your wallet.

[15:09] **Anthony Ferrara**: There's 240 people. There was way more people this year than last year. I'm looking at it right now, but nice. I can reach out to him directly.

[15:23] **Andrew Smyth**: Sure. It seems like he's a lot of stuff going on, so a lot of cool stuff going on. All right, cool. So I guess biggest lowest hanging fruit, Walmart, Jameson still Dragon is free with Dawn. So we'll send an email to her next week.

[15:48] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, he's applying for jobs at Dropbox and other places so he could ride that wave. Why? I don't know. Walmart's not a big sexy tech company in his mind. He's. He always gets antsy.

[16:07] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, but their CEO is, like, so AI first. Like, they're one of the biggest first retailers to partner with Sam in chat. Like, I don't know, but maybe he disagrees with the direction or something.

[16:24] **Anthony Ferrara**: I gotta hit up Justin again. He canceled on me, and then I had to ride.

[16:28] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. Okay, well, you do that. So yeah, Apex, a lot of fucking work. This guy's kind of a tweak. Definitely a little bit of a red flag. I made it abundantly clear that a low trust micro managing environment doesn't bode well with us and that if he is going to do that, then we shouldn't partner. Respectfully, but he did come from Shiloh. So, like, I kind of want to ride it out and not, like, piss him away because it's just, like, Justin's word.

[17:08] **Andrew Smyth**: But I don't know if you saw the triple lift had, like, 115 increase and sheared. Excuse me. Shear ID had 115. Triple up had, like, a 45.

[17:20] **Anthony Ferrara**: That's epic.

[17:21] **Andrew Smyth**: That's epic.

[17:22] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah.

[17:23] **Andrew Smyth**: So referrals, references, excuse me, references. So I'm going to send them Justin's contact info. Do you feel comfortable sending this guy to call anybody else? If so, who? Should I just put Brandy down and then someone else?

[17:44] **Anthony Ferrara**: Brandy for sure. Because there's just so many Pro, there's so many companies we've worked with through her.

[17:53] **Andrew Smyth**: And did one more and it should be fine.

[17:55] **Anthony Ferrara**: I mean, Brandon or Brandy, Justin Benson. I honestly would do someone at Shear ID. I would do Diana because she is happy with us from Triple Lift and then. Somebody at ShearID, maybe Laura Crofton, she's who I always had the most, the strongest relationship with. Laura Compton, like Compton, like City of Compton, yeah. L-A-R-A. If you just open a new Slack, you should be able to see her in there.

[18:41] **Andrew Smyth**: Okay.

[18:45] **Anthony Ferrara**: But this is her email. Because we worked with her on Ruby and Ruby was like a 300% increase.

[18:52] **Andrew Smyth**: Oh, sweet. I know that.

[18:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay.

[18:56] **Andrew Smyth**: There it is, laura.com. Okay, sweet.

[18:59] **Anthony Ferrara**: So, Laura, CheeriD, Ruby, Brandy, all the five or six companies we worked at, and then.

[19:07] **Andrew Smyth**: That should be good, man. We don't need to send it.

[19:09] **Anthony Ferrara**: Justin Blanston.

[19:09] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, it's just Justin. All right, great. So Better Days Closed, Sorbon, little addendum right now it's 4.6 K, but they might balk at the animation price, but it just takes a lot of hours to get that done. Latest sent to Patty, latest sent to Nest Egg, Cascade like doubled, more than doubled.

[19:35] **Anthony Ferrara**: Dude, that's so good.

[19:36] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, you owe, we definitely owe Kingsley like a golf round or something or some love because he's just been going to bat for us and he's talking, he got brought in to like kind of clean things up about the operations of the company. So he did, he's doing that while he's winding down with well beings and then he's also, you're gonna be working with him directly to architect their entire product. It's like a three prong product again. So the first sprint's like the whole user journey for everything.

[20:10] **Andrew Smyth**: And the second sprint is like just get as much high fidelity designs done as possible.

[20:16] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah.

[20:17] **Andrew Smyth**: And he also asked for like, I gave him like 10 hours a week of brand collateral, marketing collateral. Stuff. So we've been texting over the weekend. He's like, we're gonna finalize it, we're gonna finalize it, we're gonna finalize it. You know, they do want to start yesterday. So I'll text him again today. But that will definitely close in some capacity. But he told me on Friday, he talked, he's talking with the co founder.

[20:48] **Andrew Smyth**: And he's like, you know, we're gonna bring like, if I'm working here, I'm gonna work with Oxy, and this is working at the going to cost. And he already got like verbal for like 20K a month. Nice. From the co-founder. So that's what he told me. So just passing along.

[21:07] **Anthony Ferrara**: Nice.

[21:12] **Andrew Smyth**: See, notary or meeting with them. This Colombian company, I sent them a 12 page proposal in Colombian Spanish using eustis instead of the other verb conjugate I forget. So I did like a 10k discovery kind of similar to waste management. So it's like there's just so much we don't know about what you guys want. And then I gave ranges like 60 to 100k for the rest of this stuff. And then so they're like, hey, do another one from scratch if you don't have any of our requirements.

[21:44] **Andrew Smyth**: We don't have any of our figmas to start with. So that's even broader. But, So, no, I think I might just do like, Hey, here's what I guess 60 pay website could look like.

[22:03] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah. So, if we do the discovery, is it okay that it's in English? Would Chris have to do it because it's in Spanish?

[22:13] **Andrew Smyth**: It would be like Chris and Karen doing this project and interfacing with them the whole time. They only know Spanish.

[22:21] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay. You said he could do it, so we'll roll the dice.

[22:26] **Andrew Smyth**: We'll roll the dice. But I mean, Karen absolutely crushed it on that sales call and she slacked, called me after and was like, I really want this to work. This is really exciting. Super enthusiastic. She wants to lead it, all that stuff.

[22:40] **Anthony Ferrara**: So, I don't know.

[22:42] **Andrew Smyth**: It could be a cool stretch thing for her. Okay, couple upsells. We'll talk more on Thursday, but possibility Terrence is getting hours. I'll schedule time. We'll schedule time with Jonathan. Shiloh's been kind of quiet. We're waiting on Diana for her confirmation about, you know, an extension of a retainer, 4 to 8K a month. Either sort of see or, you know, compiled rogue work. Or a combination of brand marketing work?

[23:16] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool.

[23:17] **Andrew Smyth**: ShearID, Robert and them have been so patient and kind in helping me with Apex. So I'm like, we're kind of waiting for this storm of Apex to clear till I bug them again about the ShearID report. So I did ask them, but I just don't want to be so, so annoying because I already feel like I'm being annoying enough. To get this done. So.

[23:41] **Anthony Ferrara**: No, I mean, so, you know, Robert's a genius, but he's very, he's not reliable, so he doesn't get stuff done on time. I was talking to Mike yesterday, but we're like embedded with compiled rope, so, yeah, like this CrowdStrike thing is like such a huge deal and we have to do it right, and it's not just some other project. Like I have to be involved in it. CrowdStrike, Walmart, LinkedIn is where my focus is always going to be. And we brought them in, like we paid them like 60 K for spring training.

[24:22] **Anthony Ferrara**: And I feel like we've paid them more this year than we did last year. So like, we're one of the biggest clients, so you can demand whatever you want.

[24:33] **Andrew Smyth**: Okay, I know, but. I'm just like, and so blown was super helpful too, because he quoted out the Colombian website as well. So we were talking on Friday when he's on his vacation and he texted me Saturday, like, are you all good? Just so you know. So he's been really helpful. So that's kind of stuff in the middle towards the end of the funnel. And then top of funnel, this signal fire intro, I saw time was selected. I'll make sure that gets booked if it hasn't been.

[25:05] **Andrew Smyth**: And then yeah, we have a bunch of stuff in the top of funnel. Two most interesting leads for me, I've had discovery calls for both of these, or intro calls for both of these. So this War Horse North America group will be following up with them this week if they want to talk more about their big rebrand project. And then the Augusta Airport kind of like an Oxy Aero thing. Just some ideas, different ideas for like Masters Week. I talked with the Director of Aviation Services. He's really interested.

[25:40] **Andrew Smyth**: They have an agency that works monthly for the interior advertising services, but their contracts ending and he was like, since you're, you know, you guys seem like really cool and you're kind of young and hungry, we want to give you the inside of the whole airport and the outside and do different experiences. So there's a whole big vision. I pitched him, we could get Rolex and BMW, getting people off the jet, we can do ads on the runway, all this different type of stuff. And he's really interested, so it could be a fun little project.

[26:17] **Andrew Smyth**: But just taking it one week at a time and just trying to start somewhere small. And yeah, that's kind of all I got for right now. Oh, another thing I've been really working on for almost a year, is like, I don't know if you remember, I met this guy, he's sold into Verizon his whole life. He's this website, sportsmd.com, I've been helping him broker it and get prices and try to sell it. It has like 30K visitors a month organically just through Google search and their ranking and things.

[26:53] **Andrew Smyth**: So it's worth a good chunk of change depending on your cost per click. So I put an offer out for it finally yesterday. And sort of like once that closes and we get an LOI and we sell it, then he's like, I will open my Rolodex to you at Verizon for anything Oxy, anything AI. So that's a big enterprise thing for next year. But just putting it on your radar, I've been working on this for a year. Finally have an offer out Verizon next year.

[27:33] **Anthony Ferrara**: Oh, yeah. Those weird things could turn into something. I think just for trying to find a way, like, try to find a way where you. It's, like, more of a Surefire thing. Like, that's how I'm changing my perspective, like. I know we could do brands really easy. I know we can do websites really easy, like from an agency perspective to offer value from a sales perspective. Like what you did with fit to see, I think is the better where it's like we already have relationships with these people.

[28:09] **Anthony Ferrara**: It's easy to just connect you guys, like, versus like, I'm going to go figure out how to do something I've never done before or like, I'm not sure it would work. And it's going to take a lot of time and I'm going to promise a lot of stuff because if you can't deliver that value then it's and you wasted time and didn't get or build trust or whatever. So yeah, that's my mental model there.

[28:33] **Andrew Smyth**: Definitely.

[28:36] **Anthony Ferrara**: Thank you.

[28:36] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, definitely. The airport thing is just like a random thing, super on the edge but We'll start small, whatever, wherever we go with all this stuff. So.

[28:58] **Anthony Ferrara**: I'm putting something on Karen's list, by the way. She, weirdly, possibilities being a little guarded. I have a call with them this afternoon to introduce Chris, which I hope will make them be less carded. That's why I put it at the top of your list to. To really, like, I don't know. I I don't like the vibe that they feel that they.

[29:29] **Anthony Ferrara**: That we can't meet their standards or whatever when we're over delivering on every single thing that we do times five and, like, So they need to find a way, we need to find a way to make it right. Like, this is the overage. You are in debt to us. We've done more. And like, I think what I want to do is be like, we understand, like, we understand there's some learning curves here. So let's discount the overages and let's agree on the amount that we're going to discount at like 25% or something.

[30:02] **Anthony Ferrara**: And then, kind of take the power back and then introduce Chris as like a solution. And then what were they gonna say? So anyway, like, so they've been a little, they haven't like given Karen a ton of stuff to do. Tawny is in between projects. So one of the things I'm gonna put on her list is like building designing you a personal site so you have like just a one page Lander. What's that? You got in. How'd you get in with someone there? Okay. I'm almost done one second.

[30:45] **Anthony Ferrara**: So yeah, I'm gonna throw it on her list if she actually does have three times a day.

[30:49] **Andrew Smyth**: Dope.

[30:51] **Anthony Ferrara**: Thanks, man. So maybe you can connect with her.

[30:53] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, I love that. I have like an outline. I have a Claude project actually that I've been like, working on a prototype for great update on Telly, though. Real quick, if you like, one more minute. Dallas was a dick last week. They apologized in the call. Dallas got big dog by seho, who's like the true Head of Sales or whatever. That kind of came down to us. Matthew gave Dallas an earful about all that.

[31:24] **Andrew Smyth**: And Dallas said yesterday on the call, the rest of the team, we have a plan for things moving forward of things we're going to deliver over the next like three months. So we're going to work on that plan together. I'm going to give you guys that plan and then we can sort of schedule our deliverables out, at least from the sales side. So that was great.

[31:44] **Anthony Ferrara**: Awesome. Random thing, did you say Diana or Dana was interested in more stuff? From bold metrics or was it Diana from triple lift?

[31:54] **Andrew Smyth**: Triple lift.

[31:56] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay, I got that mixed up. Yeah.

[31:58] **Andrew Smyth**: I'm gonna schedule a wrap call with Morgan though and show them our effective hourly rate and be like, you know, just try to reconcile it well because him and I had such a great conversation. So in the beginning.

[32:15] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. Well, yeah, it's, Closed as far as I know. I mean, Rachel shared everything again. Yeah, unless they're OCD about it, it's done. But cool, man. Well, yeah, the Cascade one is the biggest one. Yeah, all those other ones are not going to be super profitable. That one will be. And then, yeah, let me know if you need any details on my list, but I. I'm in LinkedIn mode the next two days. Cool.

[32:49] **Andrew Smyth**: Have fun, man. Send me some stuff you guys are working on. I love to see. Really?

[32:54] **Anthony Ferrara**: Cool. We'll do. I will record the calls and stuff.

[32:57] **Andrew Smyth**: Cool. All right, have fun. Talk to you later.

[33:00] **Anthony Ferrara**: All right, peace. Foreign.
