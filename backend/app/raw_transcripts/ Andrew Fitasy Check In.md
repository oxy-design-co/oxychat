# Kevin / Andrew Fitasy Check In
**Date**: Tuesday, October 28, 2025 at 9:59 AM  
**Duration**: 6:01  
**People**: Andrew Smyth and Kevin Wu

[0:00] **Kevin Wu**: I think it's good. A couple of things is first of all, I think Alex James, is that Alex James?

[0:06] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, yeah.

[0:07] **Kevin Wu**: I think Alex would be great for us in terms of like a advisory capacity with his experience. I really do see him as a great person for us specifically. And I think Jack, I really like his platform. I really do think that Niall is a, you know, has a huge potential but I'm not too sure how to break into it. At this point. And yeah, no, Danelle was great, but she's probably a bit preoccupied with other commitments, so might not have a lot of capacity for us at this stage.

[0:48] **Andrew Smyth**: Okay, cool. Yeah, I mean, I don't know, Danielle, she really dove in. Spencer and I were like pleasantly surprised, so we'll we got to catch up with her, too.

[1:00] **Kevin Wu**: And.

[1:01] **Andrew Smyth**: And also as well, like, that's just how, like, everyone kind of seems pre, like, I don't know, at least, like, in, like, culture and fashion and, like, whatever. Like, a lot of people are always, like, preoccupied, and that's how they always, like, come across. So I don't, like, I think she's really interested about it, I think. We just got to figure out, like, a little bit more, like, what the shape, what. What it looks like. Maybe a second call will be good.

[1:30] **Andrew Smyth**: And, yeah, more like a collaborative call, and she can share some more thoughts or something. But, yeah, man, I thought last week was pretty exciting, so we'll line up these two next. Next introductions, hopefully by the end of the day. Yeah. And we'll get them scheduled. And then let's. Spencer and I will sort of get the next, you know, eight to ten people together, and. And you can sort of pick the next five. We can sort of do that again, maybe end of this week or early next.

[2:09] **Kevin Wu**: Okay. Yeah, I think that's. That should be good from our end.

[2:13] **Andrew Smyth**: Okay, cool.

[2:14] **Kevin Wu**: Yeah, but I think. Before we proceed with the next five, I think it's good to kind of have a kind of alignment on the expectation with the first five. Yeah, like I think for example, if let's say with the first five, we have if we can come to sort of arrangement, it'd be great. But then if let's say we can put this on hold, we can move to the next five. What do you think?

[2:44] **Andrew Smyth**: What do you mean by arrangement?

[2:47] **Kevin Wu**: Yeah, no, because you were talking about like having a second call to discuss what's going on. So let's say if all of them are, let's say if all first five go into second call and then we will have another wave of five introductions, which is okay, but then it will take a lot more time.

[3:07] **Andrew Smyth**: Right, right, right, right. Yeah.

[3:08] **Kevin Wu**: Yeah. So I think generally is like we want to kind of have five conversations going on at a time if possible. But 10 if we're stretching it, but then definitely not like 20.

[3:22] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, for sure. We wanna, I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah. So we can meet, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. I want to do that as well. And yeah, I think we could, you know, there's only so much time. I know you guys want to get things kind of bigger by the spring and stuff. Just, like, overhearing, you know, what you and Danielle were talking about when you, you know, whatever. Yeah. So time is a little bit of the essence here because, like, the holidays are coming up. The next thing you know is January.

[3:56] **Andrew Smyth**: So I I would. I think we should definitely do at least 10. Kind of. And, you know, Spencer and I will help you navigate all of this, for sure.

[4:06] **Kevin Wu**: Sure.

[4:06] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[4:08] **Kevin Wu**: 10 is good. I just don't want us to have too many conversations that be hard.

[4:14] **Andrew Smyth**: It would be chaos, yeah.

[4:16] **Kevin Wu**: Okay, well anyway, thanks for the call Andrew, really appreciate it. And so Thursday that's 11, so I think 12 o'clock Eastern Time.

[4:29] **Andrew Smyth**: Yes, yes. Okay.

[4:31] **Kevin Wu**: Yeah, it should work for me. I'm really looking forward to it.

[4:35] **Andrew Smyth**: Cool, sounds good. Oh, and also one other thing, like I know with you were like driving your girlfriend with Danielle and everything but sometimes impossible I understand but just you know try to always be in a good spot. It's quiet for these calls and I know you understand it was like a tough situation, but you know yeah, no worries.

[4:57] **Kevin Wu**: I'll be home for the yeah, no, I'll be home for the remainder of.

[5:01] **Andrew Smyth**: The conversation okay, now it's all I totally understand sometimes you just gotta you know get something done. It's totally it's all good But yeah, as we just keep having these calls and introductions, the people we're bringing in, they think you guys are awesome, right? So we want that to be reflected, you know what I mean? It's totally good. No one, Danielle didn't say anything. This is just like me, to maximize the effectiveness of these calls for you guys. It's our recommendation. Okay.

[5:34] **Kevin Wu**: All right, I really appreciate it. Thank you, Andrew.

[5:36] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, for sure. And I hope you feel better. Sorry you got the flu.

[5:40] **Kevin Wu**: Yeah, I know it says that season, so hopefully it doesn't last two weeks.

[5:44] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah. All right, cool. So we'll do the two calls, two more calls, and then we'll meet again.

[5:49] **Kevin Wu**: We only received the invitation for one call.

[5:51] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah, the second one. The second one, we're still figuring the time out right now. Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah, all good. All right, thanks so much, Kevin. Talk to you. Cheers.
