# Craig / Oxy
**Date**: Monday, October 27, 2025 at 5:00 PM  
**Duration**: 33:15  
**People**: Andrew Smyth, Anthony Ferrara, and Craig Goodwill

[0:01] **Craig Goodwill**: How are you guys?

[0:03] **Anthony Ferrara**: Doing well. Good to see you again.

[0:05] **Craig Goodwill**: Yeah, you too. So we're pushing away. We're actually doing a lot of building, but I'm finding a little frustration in terms of I come maybe in my, I feel like my post was a little bit maybe too direct in terms of my frustration, but it was kind of like Getting a lot of great feedback, meeting investors, got invited to a big Dubai accelerator. The current look and feel we're building on top of that other client portal, which was that 6 Health.

[0:46] **Craig Goodwill**: But that's not really the vision I had in terms of look and feel of what we're doing. I did that because it was a way to get something up early. Into a beta. And then I sent you that link of that other company, that Lotus Health. I don't know if you saw, you know, super slick, obviously more in the kind of AI doctor space, but doesn't really have any sort of emotional relevance.

[1:17] **Craig Goodwill**: And so I wanted to kind of just talk about One, I'm not sure if you guys do decks or if you have deck people that you really trust. It feels like it's a little bit of in many ways try to kind of piece it together and then adjust as we get feedback. But knowing that sometimes that deck just sometimes makes a huge difference. And then meeting some of these deck guys that are fucking outrageously expensive. And so, but maybe it's, you know, worth the push.

[1:53] **Craig Goodwill**: But I just didn't want to go up work someone and just pay them. I thought I'd ask you guys in terms of what your literacy is on that stuff as well as, you know, overall design take. I'm actually meeting with Jim this week as well.

[2:12] **Craig Goodwill**: Jim Carter to kind of start sketching out the next step, because I think we'll be getting some capital in, like, at least are enough to kind of get us developing and just wanted to kind of connect with you guys and get your thoughts and where you guys are at and all that stuff.

[2:33] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, for sure. I just put a link in the chat. This is my best recommendation. So there's two types of deck guys, and the ones that I find, the ones that we find are, like, the most. Worth their money are the ones that have had, that are more like advisors, they have access to capital, they shape the messaging and the narrative of the deck. Looking at your deck, it's 24 pages long. I know the first thing most people would say is connect. People just look at it, they flip through it, Yeah.

[3:13] **Craig Goodwill**: Well, they see it's 24 pages and they're like, oh, okay, I'll just flip through it. Yeah, it's 10. Let me dig in.

[3:21] **Andrew Smyth**: So.

[3:24] **Anthony Ferrara**: We are great at making it feel like a series, like a IPO company, like visually. And you have, you know, since the last time we talked, you have screens, you have a UX, you have a vision of the product. So that's great to work with. And the guy that I put in the link, his name is Anthony Ferrara. He's probably the best at just telling you it like it is straight. And the dollars per hour that you'll spend with him, he'll get you to a point where investors can even digest the idea.

[3:58] **Craig Goodwill**: And.

[4:00] **Anthony Ferrara**: You'Re going to be a great fit for him because you already have so much here. He'll just help you find the signal and the noise. And he's also done a great job for some of our clients in getting them access to more deal flow for their investors. And he's a straight shooter.

[4:17] **Craig Goodwill**: Love it.

[4:19] **Anthony Ferrara**: And he could probably also, he also brings us into design opportunities. So it depends on how he's definitely gonna care more about the messaging. Like he's, I've seen a lot of ugly decks get funded.

[4:34] **Craig Goodwill**: I know you're just like most motherfuckers.

[4:36] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah.

[4:38] **Craig Goodwill**: And we have Mona, right? Like, she was just on Shetty last week. Like, she's just blowing up. And I don't want to discredit that with a deck that, you know, and we're also getting this feed bubble. Why doesn't Will Smith just fund it? Or why is it Jay Shetty just funded? You're like, because I can't go to them for pre-seed funding.

[4:59] **Craig Goodwill**: I can go to them in series a, so it's just trying to, like, you know, and our Focus feels a little bit like we're trying to hit too many different things at once, and then we're getting drilled in this, like. And sometimes the universe is always telling you what it should be versus. And then you think, no, no, no, it should be all this. And then it can be all that, but maybe not. It's in stages, so. And there seems to be just this world of women's health. Everybody's doing AI, everybody's doing health tech.

[5:32] **Craig Goodwill**: None of it's emotional. None of it deals with the social emotional aspects of it. And it's very much geared towards men. And 80% of women make all the healthcare decisions in a family. So it's like maybe we should lean into that. So I appreciate it.

[5:49] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, I think that's the best fit, even from your email and hearing you talk, I feel even more strongly that like, a deck, and he literally just focuses on decks. Like, there's a lot of these guys that do messaging and copywriting and brand positioning. He doesn't care about any of that. He just cares about getting you funded and saying what you need to say so that investors care.

[6:12] **Craig Goodwill**: Yep.

[6:13] **Anthony Ferrara**: And he also has extended his services to where he's formed relationships for deal flow for other pre-seed Venture funds. So he's based here in Arizona, but he works with clients all over. I've got nothing but positive reviews from people we've recommended.

[6:29] **Craig Goodwill**: I've already set up a 30 minute with him.

[6:31] **Andrew Smyth**: Let's go.

[6:34] **Anthony Ferrara**: I'll tell him you're coming. But he's not the greatest designer in the world, but he will get you to a point. His value is straight shooter, gut check, hey, rip out these 10 pages and just say this, what is your narrative? He'll challenge you, he'll shape it. Hey, save that for the future. This is what investors care about. His value isn't necessarily in the design, although he can get you a better looking design than what you have now.

[7:02] **Anthony Ferrara**: If you want something just like very custom, methodical, highly polished, then a lot of times he sends them back to us.

[7:12] **Craig Goodwill**: There's a hand in hand opportunity here to kind of, because I'm really excited to get into this design stuff, but I got to like, get over this hump. And, you know, it's just fascinating as I see the world turn in this AI space, just the opportunities that exist that people are still, it's how they're seeing AI and how it's very much a, you give me this, I give you this. Like it's just a very transactional nature to AI versus this kind of and I. This nurturing.

[7:52] **Anthony Ferrara**: Tool.

[7:53] **Craig Goodwill**: I don't know if you, you know, on Tick Tock, there's a whole section of doctors who are freaking out because of AI, because people are coming to them with a way better bedside manner from AI. Everybody's dropping their. Their labs in the chat. GPT right now. Yeah, yeah. So that's great and terrible all at the same time, so. Yeah, it's exciting.

[8:19] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, the hypochondriacs are having a field day, but yeah, we're actually having a two-day session tomorrow with the meta goggles for a client that we're working with LinkedIn and we're using, there's also new surfaces. The way that you talk to AI on your phone is a little different than your computer and then you introduce goggles to it now I could see what you see and definitely the- I.

[8:53] **Craig Goodwill**: Have a group which is my back pocket. So they're out of their, what's the science award? The out of Sweden or out of fuck, the Nobel Laureate in science. So they won all these awards for and so my vision is that the ability through AR to so what they do is they take your blood and they turn it into three-dimensional engrossment. So literally you can go walk through your entire your entire biology, right? And you can actually see the trauma in your blood and you can physically walk through it and fly through it.

[9:40] **Craig Goodwill**: So and then they're attached to Riot games as a gaming engine. So they're using real engine to create to articulate the blood, turn it into a game, put it into 3D, and then ultimately you can live within your DNA and your blood sample and walk all the way through it. Wow.

[10:01] **Anthony Ferrara**: Like recontextualizing biology into a. Yeah, like.

[10:05] **Craig Goodwill**: Where mine goes is like, imagine you create a game called cancer. Right, and you send in your army that's actually into your biology to go fight the cancer. And the cancer is a series of healthy things that you can be doing with yourself to actually battle cancer. But not just cancer, but what any other disease. So rather than D, it becomes a gamification of you becoming healthier. So it's like, and those Meta glasses are ugly as sin, but ultimately, that's, they'll figure that out, but.

[10:40] **Andrew Smyth**: Oh, yeah. Have you seen the Ray bands, though?

[10:43] **Craig Goodwill**: I I have the Ray band ones with the, the little cameras in them. Cool.

[10:49] **Andrew Smyth**: Okay.

[10:51] **Craig Goodwill**: Like, I feel like Homer Simpson at church listening to the football game. Like, you know what I mean? My wife's like, why aren't you listening to anything? I'm like, I'm not.

[10:58] **Anthony Ferrara**: Because it vibrates.

[10:59] **Andrew Smyth**: Yeah.

[10:59] **Anthony Ferrara**: My dad.

[11:00] **Craig Goodwill**: Yeah. And, like, she could hear me listen to the football game just as she leans in really quietly. But yeah, but the big ones, the big new ones, the AR ones, man, they're big. Not quite yet. Yeah. Yeah.

[11:14] **Anthony Ferrara**: We just released like three weeks ago. We're already messing with them to build. If you had a chatbot that only you could see, if I was on this call right now, I could, if I'm looking out of the corner of my eye, I could be sending signals or accepting proactive recommendations. So we're really obsessing over that because it's a completely new surface. But yeah, I mean, you're thinking about it the right way in terms of creating the emotional connection, the privacy concerns. I need to know what it has access to.

[11:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: I need to know how proactive it can be. Sometimes being too proactive is destructive. And moving that.

[12:01] **Craig Goodwill**: So what our studies, I'll make sure time is tight here. Our studies have been fascinating because, you know, there's one group, which is the sickest of the sickest, five percent, which costs 80 of the, of everything. But what we discovered is that for the most part, people know what they should be doing and what they should be eating. What is the Delta between knowing and doing? Right. And that can be socioeconomic, that can be shame, that can be lack of knowledge, that can be a lot of different things. Food deserts, you know, many different things.

[12:36] **Craig Goodwill**: And then the other side is everybody falls off. How do you get them back in? Because I've been really studying the male shame cycle a lot lately. You know, how we just go in these Loops of, like, eating ourselves and doing stupid things to ourselves, and then. Pulling ourselves back up. So it's just really interesting. And, you know, 100 years ago, we'd have a community that would pick you back up. You'd have a church that pick you back up. Something that would bring you back to the fold. But we're all separated.

[13:07] **Craig Goodwill**: We're all, you know, you know, living these lonely lives. And so how do you get that? How do you get the machine to be that Community that pulls you back? Or how do you interconnect individuals through a platform? And, you know, before I lose my, a friend of mine who's a giant sports doctor for, like, Beckham and all this kind of stuff, I was. So I've been offered this group, which is these. I don't know if you're soccer fans, but the Legends of Soccer.

[13:37] **Craig Goodwill**: So I have access now to the Legends of Soccer and creating individual, like, Avatar using this tool to create, like, really interesting, like train with your favorite soccer player. And in talking to their doc, their doctors, I mentioned this idea of being able to train at the same time as, like, Ronaldinho or whoever the modern day version of that is. And he, they loved it. They love that idea that you could be training at the same seven o'clock time as your star and you're matching and this falls into AR.

[14:16] **Craig Goodwill**: Imagine the ability to actually train alongside. So it's just a really exciting time right now. And I love that you guys are working with that stuff because it just feels like no one's figured it out yet. But I also heard that they're coming out because Google's Meta, Google's, or the Vision Pros are just The version two is just as not as good, just as bad as the version one. So it's interesting to see what the evolution and the wearables are all around that.

[14:52] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, I'll shoot you a video. We did it in 72 hours, so don't judge it too harshly. It was for a big summit at LinkedIn about how they're obsessing over the product we're working on specifically is like trying to revolutionize the workspace. What is coming into the office mean? If you have an organizational AI and a personal AI, they envision a world where you take a meeting and by the end of the meeting, the work is done. There's no follow-up. AI is like a co-creator. You could pull up charts that could inform you.

[15:30] **Anthony Ferrara**: It could talk over you. This little meeting recorder we have here, Circleback, if it could participate in our meeting, and conceptualize product.

[15:40] **Craig Goodwill**: I think the guy could jump in and go, you guys are missing the whole point of the conversation. Like, that's, you know, what I love about AI is people are like, oh, I get all my answers. I'm like, fuck that. I get more questions from it. I just keep digging into digging and digging. And that's what it's really exciting about, is that it challenges, it shows you blind spots that you're just not thinking about. And I find that super cool. And I'm really interested what's going on in the avatar space.

[16:10] **Craig Goodwill**: Delphi, I don't know if you saw them, they turned off their avatar portion of their Delphi, which is a big, they left ours on because I'm like, what the fuck? Why are we with, you're just an AI avatar, like a voice system now. How is that relevant? So I don't know if you guys are in that space or seeing what's going on in terms of conversational avatars and if you see other companies who are jumping into that space.

[16:44] **Craig Goodwill**: But yeah, it's a bigger discussion because I really do see the UX being very avatar driven versus kind of like even like we're talking to like whoop and all these i fits and everybody and they're like, oh, well, everybody. I'm like, no one gives a about their hrv. Like, no one. Just tell me how i'm doing. Tell me how I could do better. Be nice to me, be compassionate to me. It's just a really fascinating time. The biggest.

[17:13] **Anthony Ferrara**: I'm not the most into that space, but i'll ask some of the guys that are going to be here tomorrow. We've obsessed over voice and how to make voice. Nuanced and how to anticipate when someone stopped talking and things like that. But what were you gonna say, Andrew?

[17:30] **Andrew Smyth**: Oh, no. I was just gonna say, yeah, similar lines. I'm not so into it, but Elon's AI company bought a guy. It's pretty much one guy who's worked on these companions, and they're pretty good. I'm pulling it up right now. This is like a fox, I guess.

[17:49] **Craig Goodwill**: Is it a metahuman? Have you played with metahuman at all or anything like that?

[17:53] **Andrew Smyth**: That might be it. Maybe.

[17:54] **Craig Goodwill**: Is that nice?

[17:56] **Andrew Smyth**: I don't know. But yeah, like, this is the Grok app. Hey, how's it going?

[18:03] **Craig Goodwill**: I don't know if you can hear me.

[18:06] **Andrew Smyth**: Oh, I can see. Oh, okay. Let me ask it something. There we go. But yeah, this is like, you know, this is only on my iPhone screen, right? Just wrapped up a sandwich that was 90% mustard.

[18:19] **Anthony Ferrara**: You?

[18:20] **Andrew Smyth**: But you can imagine like it has a personality and like a kid.

[18:23] **Craig Goodwill**: Love Charlie Kirk Right oh, thanks grock nice to see you.

[18:31] **Andrew Smyth**: But yeah, I that's the only thing I only like big companion thing I saw yeah, they got they started with like three anime characters and two like.

[18:40] **Craig Goodwill**: Cartoons so yeah, I'm gonna send you my buddy is doing so my buddy is a big environmentalist and he's done this thing called Oxy. I'm going to send it to you, which is like, it's called Oxy systems. I'll put it in the chat here. So basically, it's basically a group I want to bring in, and I'd love to introduce you to them. They figured out. Alignment protocol, and they use the methodology of how planets are formed.

[19:26] **Craig Goodwill**: And then I extrapolated how the planet is formed to how humans are formed through pressure, the environment and all these different things. And ultimately it's about how our environment shapes our overall perceptions, even getting to things like the Halo effect. And the Halo effect is this idea that I may say the same thing as Anthony, and Anthony may say the same thing to Andrew, but you're going to accept it differently based on my tonality, based on frequency. You know, we're really falling into this healing frequencies that can happen. And so we're even studying Mona's voice.

[20:04] **Craig Goodwill**: Why do people accept Mona's voice over other voices? And so. So you guys falling into the. Voice cloning world, hidden hertz and frequencies can actually be embedded with silent frequencies can be embedded within the voice communication system that can be more healing and not even perceived. And so there's some really interesting technology and stuff that's going on and we're trying to adopt it in a way that kind of lives in the background, but ultimately could be something that kind of sets you apart as well.

[20:41] **Andrew Smyth**: This is awesome. I haven't even thought about it. I'm going to read this whole thing in like five minutes. We get off here. But I saw another guy calling for a similar thing, but like not, that wasn't an emotional appeal. It was more technical. Like he was like, I don't want, if I don't have permission, like Craig, we got on this call, our AI recorders in here. Like you have permission to like decline that, right? We could remove it. Some people, there's softwares where you can just record the meeting. And doesn't even appear in here.

[21:11] **Andrew Smyth**: So you as an external participant wouldn't even know. And so he's like, that's BS, you know, I don't want that. I know it's possible to embed signals that almost like jams the recorder. So it's like you can't transcribe the report.

[21:27] **Craig Goodwill**: You should read Dan Brown's new book. I think it's called Secrets of Secrets or something.

[21:34] **Anthony Ferrara**: It's the guy that was talking about it yesterday.

[21:36] **Andrew Smyth**: I don't know why.

[21:37] **Craig Goodwill**: It's fucking so good and it's all about global consciousness and ultimately it's the next battle line of warfare of global consciousness and how the subconscious is the next battleground. And it's just, it's incredible. And so my body is a huge environmentalist, like militant environmentalist. And so I just, so he's talking about the earth and I said, well, the effects on the earth are just human beings are just their own planets. And ultimately how do these things in the environment, our relationships, food, culture, music, impact us? And then how do we find perfect alignment with ourselves?

[22:23] **Craig Goodwill**: Because we know that feeling, that moment we have, whether you just finished yoga or you just finished a run or you just finished sex or you just whatever it is, there's that moment and it's like trying to find if you can dial in that moment. And it's all around this idea of, like, the frequency of, you know, the radio station of your life is always playing. You just need to tune it in. So how do we do that through the technology? So, anyways, big discussions. Thank you, guys. Thank you for the introductions of this guy.

[22:53] **Craig Goodwill**: Hopefully, if that works out, then maybe we'll be discussing. Some fine tuning of that deck. And ultimately, I'm going to be sending over to Figma to you guys just so you can see the flow cycle of currently where it is now. Again, this was built in terms of to be designed onto a system that's already implemented in the Hippo place, but I'm not locked to at all.

[23:24] **Craig Goodwill**: I'm just trying to find a bridge that can show people how to interact with an AI bot that's HIPAA compliant, that takes in all your labs, that takes in all your wearables, that can give you rituals and compassionate AI. And so we're kind of communicating this kind of level three of AI, which was more compassionate version than kind of what's going on now.

[23:47] **Anthony Ferrara**: For sure. So when you send over the Figma, we should Digest it as if like this is just like a conceptual visual of your concept and it's like imagine.

[23:59] **Craig Goodwill**: That you were put into a box of an app that already exists and then you want to take your new beautiful idea and smash it in that box so it so 20% of it could work as some form of beta representation but when financed would be all thrown out yet the concept of of alignment, rituals, scheduling, emotional AI, how it's always encouraging you. So what we found is that, you know, Mona's on the science Council for iFit. iFit is the, you know, treadmills and different things like that.

[24:45] **Craig Goodwill**: Their AI just says, oh, you missed it's 9 0 2. You missed your workout today. What happened? Mona's like, well, holy. Like, sorry, I missed. Like, I don't need another thing judging me. I don't need my Aura judging me anymore. I don't need my whoop telling me that I ate like. And I'm going against my calorie count. This is more about the idea of a companion that someone is supporting who someone's like, how are you feeling today? Are you feeling better today than you did yesterday? Yes.

[25:14] **Craig Goodwill**: Journalization, how do we take, how do we create a journaling system that is easy slider so people can just tell you how they're feeling? How does prompting get you in? So a lot of different kind of mechanisms and communication systems that allow easy input but feeling supported along the way. That's going to be the mission to all this. And then that company I sent you, they're really. The one thing I really like is that they tap right into your medical records.

[25:47] **Andrew Smyth**: So.

[25:47] **Craig Goodwill**: Which means you're automatically dealing. Now, you have an onboarded. You don't know what your epigenetics is. You don't know a bunch of their information, but I'm. I got access to your medical records really fast. I love that. But then there's so much more. So there's. What I like is that there's people do out there doing some cool that we can kind of. Inspire off of, but then build towards.

[26:15] **Craig Goodwill**: And how do we build towards around this ecosystem where the AI is a physical human being like Mona that has a presence, that has a media presence that, you know, people come to for what she can offer. So how do we capture that in terms of a platform?

[26:34] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, you're trying to solve what I hear is like the emotional, the psychological, the higher level. Maslow hierarchy of needs, problems about your health.

[26:44] **Craig Goodwill**: Because we all know what makes us healthy. We all know what we should be eating and not drinking or smoking or whatever it is, but what is the barrier to be truly aligned in yourself? I think if we can, it's a big ask, but what is, and I think that people are afraid of what it feels like to feel great. I don't think people remember what it's like to feel great. I think people are covered in fear and people are covered in anxiety and I don't think they remember what it was to feel great.

[27:14] **Craig Goodwill**: And I think, and sadly in this country, it's very clouded. So I think it's going to be a lot of, you know, bringing those guys in because they've already built the back end system for me, which is like the eye of Salaman, which is like this kind of rotating symbol which you set into alignment.

[27:33] **Craig Goodwill**: And then if I'm working from a perspective where I want as a doctor to, because part of our system is that we have a desktop system that you can control and manage all your clients or your community or your hotel guests, the happiness index. And how do I deploy AI suggested ideas to that individual or to the group? To boost their serotonin, to make them feel better, to make them feel seen.

[28:03] **Craig Goodwill**: And right now we have a thousand people going through Mona's AI right now, all mostly women, and they feel seen for the first time ever.

[28:14] **Anthony Ferrara**: And that prototype is a chat experience today?

[28:18] **Craig Goodwill**: It starts with Delphi. But within about two minutes, they switch over to the voice. And then their next iterations are usually chat. So my philosophy is that I think there's a visual representation and comfort level that starts. And then there's specific things that we want with voice, which is like a daily affirmation, which is always. And then there's just core usage, like diet plans or advice or whatever it may be.

[28:52] **Craig Goodwill**: We find usages in the middle of the night tend to be voice because people are looking for calming experience, like I can't sleep, all that stuff, and then more utilitarian stuff during the day.

[29:04] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah, that's exactly where our head is on all the AI apps we're working on. What context would I use voice? Should this feature be available in every surface or interface, or is this only a voice feature? This is only a text features, this is only a visual feature and that it makes your product like three times more complicated in a way because you have three different ways to interact.

[29:34] **Craig Goodwill**: Sometimes you need a call from your mom. Yeah. Sometimes you need a call from your dad and I don't know what everybody's familiar situations are but your text with your dad or text your mom. Yeah, things are good. Yeah, yeah, I'll do this. Yeah, yeah and then sometimes you need to hear their voice. Yeah, it's that learning of like fuck it.

[29:57] **Craig Goodwill**: I'm calling you I'm going to call you you need let's yous need to hear voice of encouragement because then you just internal sound and voice loops in your head and things need to break out and again disperse, dispersing, healing Earths and frequencies. And Mona's voice is a frequency. You know, your father's voice is a frequency. Like, and it's really tapping into how do we use these for healing properties and encouragement? For sure.

[30:33] **Anthony Ferrara**: That's. I called my mom last night, and I needed to call my mom, so you're. You're resonating with me on that one, but this is some cool stuff, Craig. I'm glad. I'm glad we were super happy to see your name in our inbox. I just texted Anthony Ferrara, another Anthony. He's excited to meet with you. He's confirmed the invite.

[30:54] **Craig Goodwill**: And I'm going to bring, I'm going to bring Mona onto that as well so that we can get kind of a full embodiment of what we're trying to do and go from there.

[31:03] **Anthony Ferrara**: Italian guy, straight shooter, will probably try to help you. He. He will try to capture the essence of your idea, but communicate it in a way that an investor is going to digest it. And, like, he's really going to push you to simplify.

[31:22] **Craig Goodwill**: And I need to kill my babies. And, you know, we use it all the time, which is. Yeah, we need to get down to the basics, figure it out. What's the ask? Yeah, no, they're gonna want a bunch of information as due diligence and stuff, but we don't have to Blind them with that up front.

[31:39] **Anthony Ferrara**: Yeah. He's not gonna be afraid to argue with you. And I think, oh, good.

[31:44] **Craig Goodwill**: I am. I am looking for my white knight just to take me out of this, like, this prison of, like, you know, you know, loving your own too much.

[31:53] **Andrew Smyth**: Cool.

[31:53] **Anthony Ferrara**: Well, then he's gonna be great for you guys.

[31:59] **Craig Goodwill**: Anthony, could you do me a favor? Can you send him? I didn't. Put the latest deck.

[32:06] **Anthony Ferrara**: Permission to send a deck?

[32:07] **Craig Goodwill**: Permission to send, not the one I just sent you, the link, the doc send one.

[32:13] **Anthony Ferrara**: Okay.

[32:14] **Craig Goodwill**: You have that one?
