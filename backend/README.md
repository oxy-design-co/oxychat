# ChatKit Python Backend

> For the steps to run both fronend and backend apps in this repo, please refer to the README.md at the top directory insteaad.

This FastAPI service wires up a minimal ChatKit server implementation with tools for weather and theme switching.

## Features

- **ChatKit endpoint** at `POST /chatkit` that streams responses using the ChatKit protocol when the optional ChatKit Python package is installed.
- **Guardrail-ready system prompt** extracted into `app/constants.py` so it is easy to modify.
- **REST helpers**
  - `GET  /health` â€“ surface a basic health indicator

## Getting started

To enable the realtime assistant you need to install both the ChatKit Python package and the OpenAI SDK, then provide an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
uv sync
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
